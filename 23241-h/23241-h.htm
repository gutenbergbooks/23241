</div><p>HE title of this book sufficiently interprets its purpose. I hope it may
lead to such practical meditation upon the Word of God as will supply
vision to common tasks, and daily nourishment to the conscience and
will. And I trust that it may so engage the thoughts upon the wonders of
meditation, as will fortify the soul for its high calling in Jesus Christ

<h2><em>THE UNKNOWN JOURNEY</em></h2>

<p class="center">&ldquo;<em>He went out not knowing whither he went.</em>&rdquo;<br />
&mdash;<span class="smcap">Hebrews</span> xi. 6-10.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 80px;">
<img src="images/img-a.png" width="80" height="80" alt="A" title="" />
</div>
<p>BRAM began his journey without any knowledge of his ultimate destination.
He obeyed a noble impulse without any discernment of its consequences. He
took &ldquo;one step,&rdquo; and he did not &ldquo;ask to see the distant scene.&rdquo; And that
is faith, to do God&#8217;s will here and now, quietly leaving the results to
Him. Faith is not concerned with the entire chain; its devoted attention
is fixed upon the immediate link. Faith is not knowledge of a moral
process; it is fidelity in a moral act. Faith leaves something to the
Lord; it obeys His immediate commandment and leaves to Him direction and
destiny.</p>

<p>And so faith is accompanied by serenity. &ldquo;He that believeth shall not make
haste&rdquo;&mdash;or, more literally, &ldquo;shall not get into a fuss.&rdquo; He shall not get
into a panic, neither fetching fears from his yesterdays nor from his
to-morrows. Concerning his yesterdays faith says, &ldquo;Thou hast beset me
behind.&rdquo; Concerning his to-morrows faith says, &ldquo;Thou hast beset me
before.&rdquo; Concerning his to-day faith says, &ldquo;Thou hast laid Thine hand
upon me.&rdquo; That is enough, just to feel the pressure of the guiding hand.</p>

<h2><em>THE LARGER OUTLOOK</em></h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Genesis</span> xv. 5-18.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 80px;">
<img src="images/img-a.png" width="80" height="80" alt="A" title="" />
</div><p>ND He brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven!&rdquo; The
tent was changed for the sky! Abraham sat moodily in his tent: God brought
him forth beneath the stars. And that is always the line of the Divine
leading. He brings us forth out of our small imprisonments and He sets our
feet in a large place. He desires for us height and breadth of view. For
&ldquo;as the heavens are high above the earth&rdquo; so are His thoughts higher than
our thoughts, and His ways than our ways. He wishes us, I say, to exchange
the tent for the sky, and to live and move in great, spacious thoughts of
His purposes and will.</p>

<p>How is it with our love? Is it a thing of the tent or of the sky? Does it
range over mighty spaces seeking benedictions for a multitude? Or does it
dwell in selfish seclusion, imprisoned in merely selfish quest? How is it
with our prayers? How big are they? Will a tent contain them, or do they
move with the scope and greatness of the heavens? Do they just contain our
own families, or is China in them, and India, and &ldquo;the uttermost parts of
the earth&rdquo;? &ldquo;Look now towards the heavens!&rdquo; Such must be our outlook if we
are the companions of God.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 480px;">
<img src="images/imgflowers-odd.png" width="480" height="86" alt="Page decoration" title="" />
</div>

<h2><em>THE NEVER-FAILING SPRINGS</em></h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Genesis</span> xvii. 1-8.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 80px;">
<img src="images/img-i.png" width="80" height="80" alt="I" title="" />
</div><p>&nbsp;WILL establish My covenant.&rdquo; The good promises of God are never
revoked. They are like springs which know no shrinking in times of
drought. Nay, in time of drought they reveal a richer fulness. The
promises are confirmed in the hour of my need, and the greater my need the
greater is my bounty. And so it was that the Apostle Paul came to &ldquo;rejoice
in his infirmities,&rdquo; for through his infirmities he discovered the riches
of Divine grace. He brought a bigger pitcher to the fountain, and he
always carried it away full. &ldquo;As thy days so shall thy strength be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So I need never fear that the promise of yesterday will exhaust itself
before to-morrow. God&#8217;s covenant goes with us like the ever-fresh waters
of the wilderness. &ldquo;They drank of that rock which followed them, and that
rock was Christ.&rdquo; Every fulfilment of God&#8217;s promise is the pledge of one
to come.</p>

<p>God has no road without its springs. If His path stretches across the
waste wilderness the &ldquo;fountains shall break out in the desert,&rdquo; and &ldquo;the
wilderness shall rejoice and blossom as the rose.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>JANUARY The Fourth</h2>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 480px;">
<img src="images/imggrapes-even.png" width="480" height="93" alt="Page decoration" title="" />
</div>

<h2><em>THE GOD OF THEIR SUCCEEDING RACE</em></h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Exodus</span> vi. 2-8.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 80px;">
<img src="images/img-i.png" width="80" height="80" alt="I" title="" />
</div><p>&nbsp;APPEARED unto Abraham.... I will be to you a God.&rdquo; The covenant made
with the father was renewed to the children. The father&#8217;s death did not
disannul the promise of the Lord. Death has no power in the realms of
grace. His moth and his rust can never destroy the ministries of Divine
love. Abraham died and was laid to rest, but the river of life flowed on,
and the bounties of the Lord never failed. The village well quenches the
thirst of many generations: and so is it through the generations with the
wells of grace and salvation. The villagers have not to dig a new well
when the patriarch dies: &ldquo;the river of God is full of water.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And thus I am privileged to share the spiritual resources of Abraham, and
the still richer resources of the Apostle Paul. Nothing was given to him
that is withheld from me. He is like a great mountaineer, and he has
climbed to lofty heights; but I need not be dismayed. All the strength
that was given to him, in which he reached those lofty places, is mine
also. I may share his elevation and his triumph. &ldquo;For the promise is
unto you and your children, and to all that are afar off.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><em>THE FLOWERS THAT NEVER FADE</em></h2>

<p class="center">1 <span class="smcap">Peter</span> i. 1-9.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 80px;">
<img src="images/img-a.png" width="80" height="80" alt="A" title="" />
</div><p>N inheritance incorruptible.&rdquo; I am writing these words in the Island
of Arran. To-morrow I shall leave the land behind, but I shall take the
landscape with me! It will be with me in the coming winter, and I shall
gaze upon Goat Fell in the streets of New York. The land is a temporary
possession, the landscape abides!</p>

<p>The praise of men often dies with the shout that proclaims it. Another
idol appears and the feverish worship is transferred to him. The world&#8217;s
garland begins to fade as soon as it is laid upon the brow. The morning
after the coronation I possess a handful of withering leaves. But the
garland of God&#8217;s praise acquires new grace and beauty with the years. It
is never so fresh and flourishing as just when everything else is fading
away. It is glorious in the hour of death! The soul goes, wearing her
garland, into the presence of the gracious Lord who gave it.</p>

<p>We can begin even now to wear the flowers of Paradise. We can begin even
now to furnish our minds with lovely thoughts and memories. We can have
&ldquo;the mind of Christ.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>&ldquo;<em>COUNT YOUR BLESSINGS</em>&rdquo;</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Psalm</span> cv. 1-15.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 78px;">
<img src="images/img-c.png" width="78" height="80" alt="C" title="" />
</div><p>OUNT your blessings!&rdquo; Yes, but over what area shall I look for them?
There is my personal life. Let me search in every corner. I have found
forget-me-nots on many a rutty road. I have found wild-roses behind a
barricade of nettles. Professor Miall has a lecture on &ldquo;The Botany of a
Railway Station.&rdquo; He found something graceful and exquisite in the midst
of its soot and grime. So I must look even in the dark patches of life,
among my disappointments and defeats, and even there I shall find tokens
of the Lord&#8217;s presence, some flowers of His planting.</p>

<p>And there is my share in the life of the nation. &ldquo;Ye seed of Abraham His
servant, ye children of Jacob His chosen.&rdquo; There are hands that stretch
out to me from past days, laden with bequests of privilege and freedom.
Our feet &ldquo;stand in a large place,&rdquo; and the place was cleared by the
fidelity and the courage of the men of old. I have countless blessings
that were bought with blood. The red marks of sacrifice are over all my
daily ways. Let me not take the inheritance and overlook the blood marks,
and stride about as though it were nought but common ground. Mercies
abound on every hand! &ldquo;Count your blessings!&rdquo;</p>

<h2><em>A JOURNAL OF MERCIES</em></h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Nehemiah</span> ix. 6-11.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 80px;">
<img src="images/img-t.png" width="80" height="80" alt="T" title="" />
</div><p>HOU hast performed Thy words: for Thou art righteous.&rdquo; Frances Ridley
Havergal kept a journal of mercies. She had a record book, and she crowded
it with her remembrances of God&#8217;s goodness. She was always on the look-out
for tokens of the Lord&#8217;s grace and bounty, and she found them everywhere.
Everywhere she had communion with a covenant-keeping God. The Bible became
to her more and more the history of her own life and experience. Promise
after promise told the story of her own triumphs. She appropriated the
goodness of God, and she set her own seal to the testimony that God is
true.</p>

<p>Many a complaining life would be changed into music and song by a journal
of mercies. Many a fear can be dispersed by a ready remembrance. Memory
can be made the handmaid of hope. Yesterday&#8217;s blessing can kindle the
courage of to-day. That is the purposed ministry of &ldquo;the days that have
been.&rdquo; We are to harness the strength of their experiences to the tasks
and burdens of to-day; and in the remembrance of God&#8217;s providences we
shall march through our difficulties with singing.</p>

<img src="images/img-t.png" width="80" height="80" alt="T" title="" />
</div><p>HERE hath not failed one word of all His good promise.&rdquo; Supposing one
word had failed, how then? If one golden promise had turned out to be
counterfeit, how then? If the ground had yielded anywhere we should
have been fearful and suspicious at every part of the road. If the bell
of God&#8217;s fidelity had been broken anywhere the music would have been
destroyed. But not one word has failed. The road has never given way in
time of flood. Every bell of heaven is perfectly sound, and the music is
full and glorious. &ldquo;God is faithful, who also will do it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;God is love,&rdquo; and &ldquo;love never faileth.&rdquo; The lamp will not die out
at the midnight. The fountain will not fail us in the wilderness. The
consolations will not be wanting in the hour of our distresses. Love will
have &ldquo;all things ready.&rdquo; &ldquo;He has promised, and shall He not do it?&rdquo; All
the powers of heaven are pledged to the fulfilment of the smallest word of
grace. We can never be deserted! &ldquo;God cannot deny Himself.&rdquo; Every word of
His will unburden its treasure at the appointed hour, and I shall be rich
with the strength of my God.</p>

<h2><em>THE PERILS OF POSSESSIONS</em></h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Genesis</span> xiii. 1-9.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 80px;">
<img src="images/img-t.png" width="80" height="80" alt="T" title="" />
</div><p>HERE is nothing more divisive than wealth. As families grow rich their
members frequently become alienated. It is rarely, indeed, that love
increases with the increase of riches. Luxurious possessions appear to be
a forcing-bed in which the seeds of sleeping vices waken into strength.
For one thing, selfishness is often quickened with success. Plenty, as
well as penury, can &ldquo;freeze the genial currents of the soul.&rdquo; And with
selfishness comes a whole brood of mean and petty dispositions. Envy comes
with it, and jealousy, and a morbid sensitiveness which readily leaps into
strife.</p>

<p>So do our possessions multiply our temptations. So does the bright day
&ldquo;bring forth the adder.&rdquo; So do we need extra defences when &ldquo;fortune smiles
upon us.&rdquo; But our God can make us proof against &ldquo;the fiery darts&rdquo; of
success. Abram remained unscathed in &ldquo;the garish day.&rdquo; The Lord delivered
him from &ldquo;the destruction that wasteth at noonday.&rdquo; His wealth increased,
but it was not allowed to force itself between his soul and God. In the
midst of all his prosperity, he dwelt in &ldquo;the secret place of the Most
High,&rdquo; and he abode in &ldquo;the shadow of the Almighty.&rdquo;</p>

</div><p>OOK at Lot. He was a man of the world, sharp as a needle, having an eye
to the main chance. He boasted to himself that he always &ldquo;took in the
whole situation.&rdquo; He said that what he did not know was not worth knowing.
But such &ldquo;knowing&rdquo; men have always very imperfect sight. Lot saw &ldquo;all the
well-watered plain of Jordan,&rdquo; but he overlooked the city of Sodom and its
exceedingly wicked and sinful people. And the thing he overlooked was the
biggest thing in the outlook! It was to prove his undoing, and to bring
his presumptuous selfishness to the ground.</p>

<p>Look at Abram. His spirit was cool and thoughtful, unheated by the
feverish yearning after increased possessions. He had a &ldquo;quiet eye,&rdquo; the
fruit of his faithful communion with God. He was more intent on peace than
plenty. He preferred fraternal fellowship to selfish increase. And so he
chose the unselfish way, and along that way he discovered the blessing of
God. &ldquo;The Lord is mindful of His own. He remembereth His children.&rdquo; In the
unselfish way we always enjoy the Divine companionship, and in that
companionship we are endowed with inconceivable wealth.</p>

</div><p>HINK of Lot and then think of a lily of the field! Think of the
feverishness of the one and of the serenity of the other, or think of the
ugly selfishness of the one, and of the graceful beauty of the other! Look
upon avarice at its worst, upon a Shylock, and then gaze upon a lily of
the field! How alarming is the contrast! The one is self-made, guided by
vicious impulses; the other is the handiwork of God. The one is rooted in
self-will; the other is rooted in the power of the Divine grace. God has
nothing to do with the one; He has everything to do with the other. So one
becomes &ldquo;big&rdquo; and ugly; the other grows in strength and beauty.</p>

<p>Now the wonder is this, that we, too, may be rooted in the power from
which the lily draws its grace. We may draw into our souls the wealth of
the Eternal, even the unsearchable riches of Christ. We may put on &ldquo;the
beauty of holiness.&rdquo; We may become clothed in the graces of the Spirit.
When we are in the field of the lilies we may appear unto the Lord as
kindred flowers of His own garden.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He that abideth in Me and I in him the same bringeth forth much fruit.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Rooted in Him,&rdquo; we shall &ldquo;grow up in all things unto Him.&rdquo;</p>

</div><p>O man can love two opposites any more than he can walk in contrary
directions at the same time. No man can at once be mean and magnanimous,
chivalrous and selfish. We cannot at the same moment dress appropriately
for the arctic regions and the tropics. And we cannot wear the habits of
the world and the garments of salvation. When we try to do it the result
is a wretched and miserable compromise. I have seen a shopkeeper on the
Sabbath day put up one shutter, out of presumed respect for the Holy Lord,
and behind the shutter continue all the business of the world! That one
shutter is typical of all the religion that is left when a man &ldquo;loves the
world&rdquo; and delights in its prizes and crowns. His religion is a bit of
idle ritual which is an offence unto God!</p>

<p>So I must make my choice. Shall I travel north or south? Which of the two
opposites shall I love&mdash;God or the world? Whichever love I choose will
drive out and quench the other. And thus if I choose the love of God it
will destroy every worldly passion, and the river of my affections and
desires will be like &ldquo;the river of water of life, clear as crystal.&rdquo;</p>

<img src="images/img-h.png" width="80" height="80" alt="H" title="" />
</div><p>E turneth ... the dry ground into water-springs.&rdquo; This is one of the
miracles of grace. The good Lord makes a dry experience the fountain of
blessing. I pass into an apparently waste place and I find riches of
consolation. Even in &ldquo;the valley of the shadow&rdquo; I come upon &ldquo;green
pastures&rdquo; and &ldquo;still waters.&rdquo; I find flowers in the ruts of the hardest
roads if I am in &ldquo;the way of God&#8217;s commandments.&rdquo; God&#8217;s providence is the
pioneer of every faithful pilgrim. &ldquo;His blessed feet have gone before.&rdquo;
What I shall need is already foreseen, and foresight with the Lord means
forethought and provision. Every hour gives the loyal disciples surprises
of grace.</p>

<p>Let me therefore not fear when the path of duty turns into the wilderness.
The wilderness is as habitable with God as the crowded city, and in His
fellowship my bread and water are sure. The Lord has strange manna for the
children of disappointment, and He makes water to &ldquo;gush forth from the
rock.&rdquo; Duty can lead me nowhere without Him, and His provision is abundant
both in &ldquo;the thirsty desert and the dewy mead.&rdquo; There will be a spring at
the foot of every hill, and I shall find &ldquo;lilies of peace&rdquo; in the lonely
valley of humiliation.</p>

</div><p>EWARE ... lest when thou hast eaten and art full ... thine heart be
lifted up, and thou forget the Lord thy God.&rdquo; I was in a little cottage
near Warwick. I said to the good man who lived in it, &ldquo;Can you see the
castle?&rdquo; and he replied, &ldquo;We can see it best in the winter when the leaves
are off the trees. In the summer time it is apt to be hid!&rdquo; The summer
bounty hid the castle; the winter barrenness revealed it! And so it is in
life. In the season of fulness we are prone to be blind to &ldquo;the house of
many mansions,&rdquo; and we forget the Master of the house, the Lord our God.
Our material wealth hides our eternal treasure.</p>

<p>What, then, shall we do in the days of our prosperity, when all our trees
are in full leaf? We must pray that material things may never become
opaque, that they may be always transparent, so that through the seen we
may behold the unseen. This is a gift of the Spirit, and it may be ours.
He will anoint our eyes with the eye-salve of grace, and everything will
become to us a symbol of something better, so that even in the midst of
material plenty our hearts will be with our treasure in heaven. Everything
will be to us &ldquo;as it were transparent glass.&rdquo;</p>

</div><p>HE Lord hath been mindful of us: He will bless us.&rdquo; In that joyful
assurance there is both retrospect and prospect. There is the trodden
pathway of Providence, and there is the star of hope! The eyes are
steadied and refreshed in sacred memories, and then they gaze into the
future with serene and happy confidence. And so the Ebenezer of the soul
becomes both a thanksgiving and a reconsecration.</p>

<p>Now perhaps our hopes are thin because our praises are scanty. Perhaps our
expectations are clouded because our memories are dim. There is nothing so
quickens hope as a journey among the mercies of our yesterdays. The heart
lays aside its fears amid the accumulated blessings of our God. Worries
pass away like cloudlets in the warmth of a summer&#8217;s morning. And the
recollections of God&#8217;s goodness always make summer even in the wintriest
day.</p>

<p>Now I see why the New Testament is so urgent in the matter of praise.
Without praise many other virtues and graces cannot be born. Without
praise they have no breath of life. Praise quickens a radiant company
of heavenly presences, and among them is the shining spirit of hope.</p>

what I am tempted to forget. I think of myself as one of an innumerable
multitude, no one of whom receives personal attention. &ldquo;My way is
overlooked by my God.&rdquo; But here is the evangel&mdash;the Saviour would
miss me, even me!</p>

<p>At a great orchestral rehearsal, which Sir Michael Costa was conducting,
the man who played the piccolo stayed his fingers for a moment, thinking
that his trifling contribution would never be missed. At once Sir Michael
raised his hand, and said: &ldquo;Stop! Where&#8217;s the piccolo?&rdquo; He missed the
individual note. And my Lord needs the note of my life to make the music
of His Kingdom, and if the note be absent He will miss it, and the
glorious music will be broken and incomplete.</p>

<p>There is a common vice of self-conceit, but there is also a common vice of
excessive self-depreciation. &ldquo;My Lord can do nothing with me!&rdquo; Yes, my
Lord knows thee and needs thee! And by the power of His grace thou canst
accomplish wonders!</p>

<img src="images/img-t.png" width="80" height="80" alt="T" title="" />
</div><p>HIS is spiritual discernment. We may test our growth in grace by our
expertness in detecting the voice of our Lord. It is the skill of the
saint to catch &ldquo;the still small voice&rdquo; amid all the selfish clamours of
the day, and amid the far more subtle callings of the heart. It needs a
good ear to catch the voice of the Lord in our sorrows. I think it
requires a better ear to discern the voice amid our joys! The twilight
helps me to be serious; the noonday glare tends to make me heedless.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>And they follow Me!</em>&rdquo; Discernment is succeeded by obedience. That is the
one condition of becoming a saint&mdash;to follow the immediate call of the
Lord. And it is the one condition of becoming an expert listener. Every
time I hear the voice, and follow, I sharpen my sense of hearing, and the
next time the voice will sound more clear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>And I give unto them eternal life.</em>&rdquo; Yes, life is found in the ways of
a listening obedience. Every faculty and function will be vitalized when I
follow the Lord of life and glory. &ldquo;In Christ shall all be made alive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>My Saviour, graciously give me the listening ear! Give me the obedient
heart.</p>

<h2><em>FALSE SHEPHERDS</em></h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Ezekiel</span> xxxiv. 1-10.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 80px;">
<img src="images/img-t.png" width="80" height="80" alt="T" title="" />
</div><p>HIS word of the Lord puts before me the unlovely lineaments of the false
shepherds.</p>

<p>They are self-seeking. They &ldquo;<em>feed themselves</em>,&rdquo; but they &ldquo;<em>feed not
the flock</em>.&rdquo; They take up religion for what they can make out of it! It
is a carnal ambition, not a holy service. It is used for getting, not for
giving, for self-glorification and not for self-sacrifice. It is
selfishness masquerading as holiness, the thief in the garb of the
shepherd.</p>

<p>And, therefore, the false shepherds are devoid of sympathy. &ldquo;<em>The diseased
have ye not strengthened, neither have ye healed that which was sick.</em>&rdquo;
Selfishness always tends to benumbment. Humaneness is fostered by
sacrifice. Our sympathetic chords are kept refined by chivalrous deeds.
Drop the deeds and all our refinements begin to coarsen, and we make no
response to our brother&#8217;s cries of need and pain.</p>

<p>And because there is no sympathy there is no quest. &ldquo;<em>My sheep wandered
... and none did seek after them.</em>&rdquo; How can we seek them if we have never
missed them, if we have no sense that they are lost? Our Lord came in
travail of soul to &ldquo;seek that which was lost.&rdquo; And I must share His
travail if I would share in the search.</p>

Good Shepherd.</p>

<p>The Good Shepherd searches the &ldquo;far country&rdquo; for His lost sheep. &ldquo;<em>I will
bring them ... out of all places where they have been scattered.</em>&rdquo; He goes
into the hard wilderness of cold indifference, and wasteful pride, and
desolating sin, searching &ldquo;high and low&rdquo; for His foolish sheep. And no
place is unvisited by the Great Seeker! Every perilous ravine, where a
sheep can be lost, knows the footprints of the Shepherd. And He knows my
far-country, and He is seeking me!</p>

<p>And the Good Shepherd brings His wandering sheep back home. &ldquo;<em>I will bring
them ... to their own land.</em>&rdquo; We return from the land of pride to the home
of lowliness, from hard indifference to gracious sympathy, from the
barrenness of sin to the beauty of holiness. We come back to God&#8217;s
beautiful &ldquo;lily-land&rdquo; of eternal light and peace.</p>

<p>And what nutriment the Good Shepherd provides for the home-coming sheep!
&ldquo;<em>I will feed them in a good pasture.</em>&rdquo; Our wasted powers shall be renewed
and strengthened by the fattening diet of grace. Love shall be both host
and meat! &ldquo;He will satisfy thy mouth with good things.&rdquo;</p>

appetite, or ravenous lust. &ldquo;Thou shalt tread upon the lion and the adder,
the young lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under feet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And the forces of nature shall be in friendly co-operation. &ldquo;<em>I will cause
the shower to come down in his season.</em>&rdquo; We are to have mystic allies in
sky and field. Nature sides with the man who sides with God. Our very
garden becomes our helpmeet when we are cultivating the fruits of the
Spirit. The heavens assume a friendly aspect when we are &ldquo;marching to
beautiful Zion.&rdquo; But when we are against the Lord all these forces appear
to be hostile. &ldquo;The stars in their courses fought against Sisera.&rdquo;</p>

Lord demands &ldquo;clean hands.&rdquo; He will not have our compliments if there is
defilement behind them. Our courtesies are rejected if iniquity attends
them. The shining gloss on the linen is an offence if the dirt looks
through! Who cares for food if presented by unclean hands? &ldquo;Be ye clean,
ye that bear the vessels of the Lord!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Every gift is welcome to the Lord if offered with clean hands. A mite, or
a cup of cold water, or our daily labour, or the first-fruits of garden or
field&mdash;all receive the blessing of our God if the hands that bring them
are free from defilement. So is it with everything we offer to the Lord. A
song of praise makes sweet music in the hearing of our God if it come from
pure lips! Purity, as Thomas a&#8217; Kempis says, gives the wings which carry

retains its voice. In some it is wealth, in others it is goodness; some
go on speaking in their cruelty, others in their gentleness. Cain still
speaks in his jealous passion. Abel speaks in his faith. Dorcas speaks in
her &ldquo;good works and alms-deeds which she did&rdquo;; Judas Iscariot speaks in
his betrayal. Yes, something goes on speaking. What shall it be?</p>

<p>But these biggest things not only continue to speak in the ears of memory,
they persist as actual forces in the common life of men. Our faith is not
buried with our bones, nor is our avarice or pride. Our characters do not

&ldquo;First be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All this tells us why some resplendent gifts are rejected, and why some
commonplace gifts are received amid heavenly song. This is why the widow&#8217;s
mite goes shining through the years. The hand that offered it was hallowed
and purified with sacrifice. Shall we say that in that palm there was
something akin to the pierced hands of the Lord? The mite had intimate
associations with the Cross.</p>

<p>And it also tells me why so much of our public worship is offensive to our
Lord. We come to the church from a broken friendship. Some holy thing has
been broken on the way. Someone&#8217;s estate has been invaded, and his
treasure spoiled. Someone has been wronged, and God will not touch our
gift. &ldquo;Leave there thy gift; first be reconciled to thy brother.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><em>THE FIRE OF ENVY</em></h2>

<p class="center">&ldquo;<em>Where envying and strife is, there is confusion and every evil
work!</em>&rdquo;<br />&mdash;<span class="smcap">James</span> iii. 13-18.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 80px;">
<img src="images/img-i.png" width="80" height="80" alt="I" title="" />
</div><p>N Milton&#8217;s &ldquo;Comus&rdquo; we read of a certain potion which has the power to
pervert all the senses of everyone who drinks it. Nothing is apprehended
truly. Sight and hearing and taste are all disordered, and the victim is
all unconscious of the confusion. The deadly draught is the minister of
deceptive chaos.</p>

<p>And envy is like that potion when it is drunk by the spirit. It perverts
every moral and spiritual sense. The envious is more fatally stricken than
the blind. He gazes upon untruth and thinks it true. He looks upon
confusion and thinks it order. Envy is colour-blind. It is like jealousy,
of which it is a blood-relation. It never sees anything in its natural
hues. It misinterprets everything.</p>

<p>No one can quench the unholy fire of envy but the mighty God Himself. It
is like a prairie fire: once kindled it is beyond our power to stamp it
out. But God&#8217;s coolness is more than a match for all our feverish heat.
His quenchings are transformations. He converts the perverted and changes
envy into goodwill. The bitter pool is made sweet. For confusion He gives
order, for ashes He gives beauty, and in the face of an old enemy we see
the countenance of a friend.</p>

<h2><em>THE CONFESSION OF SIN</em></h2>

<p class="center">&ldquo;<em>I acknowledge my transgressions;
and my sin is ever before me.</em>&rdquo;<br />
&mdash;<span class="smcap">Psalm</span> li. 1-12.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 80px;">

</div><p>IN that is unconfessed shuts out the energies of grace. Confession makes
the soul receptive of the bountiful waters of life. We open the door to
God as soon as we name our sin. Guilt that is penitently confessed is
already in the &ldquo;consuming fire&rdquo; of God&#8217;s love. When I &ldquo;acknowledge my sin&rdquo;
I begin to enter into the knowledge of &ldquo;pardon, joy, and peace.&rdquo; But if I
hide my sin I also hide myself from &ldquo;the unsearchable riches of Christ.&rdquo;
&ldquo;If we confess our sins He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and
to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I must then make confession of sin in my daily exercises in the presence
of the Lord. I am taking the way to recovered victory when I tell the Lord
the story of my defeat. Satan strengthens his awful chains when he can
induce me to keep silence concerning my sin. All his plans are thrown into
confusion as soon as I &ldquo;pour out my soul before the Lord.&rdquo; When I fall let
me not add to my guilt the further sin of secrecy. Unconfessed sin breeds
in its lurking-place and multiplies its hateful offspring. The soul that
makes confession is washed through and through, and the seeds of iniquity
are driven out of my soul.</p>

</div><p>ET all anger be put away from you.&rdquo; And yet only a moment ago the
Apostle had written the words, &ldquo;Be ye angry and sin not.&rdquo; My power of
anger is not to be destroyed, it is to be transformed and purified. Anger
can be like an unclean bonfire; it can also be like &ldquo;a sea of glass
mingled with fire.&rdquo; There can be more smoke than light in it, more selfish
passion than holy purpose. The fuel that feeds it may be envy, and
jealousy, and spite, and not a big desire for the good of men and the
glory of God. Worldly anger &ldquo;is set on fire of hell&rdquo;; holy anger borrows
flame from the altar-fires of God.</p>

<p>Our anger reveals our character. What is the quality of our anger? What
kindles it? Is it incited by our own wrongs or by the wrongs of another?
Is it set on fire by self-indulgence or by a noble sympathy? Here is a
sentence which describes the anger of the Apostle Paul: &ldquo;Who is made to
stumble and I burn not?&rdquo; Paul&#8217;s holy anger was made to burn by oppression,
by the cruelty inflicted upon his fellow-men. His fire had nothing unclean
in it; it was pure as the flame of oxygen.</p>

<p>This is the anger we must cherish. We cannot &ldquo;work ourselves up&rdquo; into it.
We must seek to be &ldquo;baptized with the Holy Ghost <em>and with fire</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>Evil for good is devil-like.</em> To receive a favour and to return a blow!
To obtain the gift of language, and then to use one&#8217;s speech to curse the
giver! To use a sacred sword is unholy warfare! All this is devil-like.</p>

<p><em>Evil for evil is beast-like.</em> Yes, the dog bites back when it is bitten.
The dog returns snarl for snarl, venom for venom. And if, when I have been
injured, I &ldquo;pay a man back in his own coin,&rdquo; if I &ldquo;give him as good as he
gave,&rdquo; I am living on the plane of the beast.</p>

<p><em>Good for good is man-like.</em> When I requite a man&#8217;s kindness by kindness!
When I send presents to one who loads me with benefits! This is a true and
manly thing to do, and lifts us far above the beast.</p>

<p><em>Good for evil is God-like.</em> Yes, that lifts me into &ldquo;the heavenly places

hearts are &ldquo;like the nether millstone,&rdquo; become springs of gentleness and
fountains of exquisite compassion. Beautiful graces, like lovely ferns,
grow in the home of severities, and transform the grim, stern soul into a

were deep in affliction. But she had never sunk! The good Lord made her

Lord, not that the waters of trouble shall never gather about the
believer, but that he shall never be overwhelmed. He shall &ldquo;keep his head

pay Him courtesy-calls, and between the calls He is forgotten. Perhaps the
call is paid once a week in the social function of worship. Perhaps it is
paid more rarely, like calls between comparative strangers. How great the
contrast between a caller and one who dwells in the secret place! It is
the difference between a flirt and a &ldquo;home-bird,&rdquo; between one who flits

</div><p>T is a blessed thing to revisit our early altars. It is good to return
to the haunts of early vision. Places and things have their sanctifying
influences, and can recall us to lost experiences. I know a man to whom
the scent of a white, wild rose is always a call to prayer. I know another
to whom Grasmere is always the window of holy vision. Sometimes a
particular pew in a particular church can throw the heavens open, and we
see the Son of God. The old Sunday-school has sometimes taken an old man
back to his childhood and back to his God. So I do not wonder that God led
Jacob back to Bethel, and that in the old place of blessing he
reconsecrated himself to the Lord.</p>

<p>It is a revelation of the loving-kindness of God that we have all these
helps to the recovery of past experiences. Let us use them with reverence.
And in our early days let us make them. Let us build altars of communion
which in later life we shall love to revisit. Let us make our early home
&ldquo;the house of God and the gate of heaven.&rdquo; Let us multiply deeds of
service which will make countless places fragrant for all our after

great rock on a storm-swept mountain side. The wind tore along the
heights, driving the rain like hail, but in the opening of the rock our
shelter was complete.</p>

<p>And the second symbol is this: &ldquo;<em>He is my high place.</em>&rdquo; The high place is
the home of the chamois, out of reach of the arrow. &ldquo;Flee as a bird to
your mountain!&rdquo; Get beyond the hunter&#8217;s range! Our security is found in
loftiness. It is our unutterable privilege to live in the heavenly places
in Christ Jesus. Such is the confidence of the righteous.</p>

<p>In this psalm there is also another pair of symbols describing the
futility of the wicked. The wicked is &ldquo;<em>as a bowing wall.</em>&rdquo; The wall is
out of perpendicular, out of conformity with the truth of the plumb-line,
and it will assuredly topple into ruin. So is it with the wicked: he is
building awry, and he will fall into moral disaster. He is also &ldquo;<em>as a

<h2><em>REGISTERING A VERDICT</em></h2>

<p class="center">&ldquo;<em>The Lord our God will we serve, and His voice will we
obey.</em>&rdquo;<br />&mdash;<span class="smcap">Joshua</span> xxiv. 22-28.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 80px;">

</div><p>ERE was a definite decision. Our peril is that we spend our life in
wavering and we never decide. We are like a jury which is always hearing
evidence and never gives a verdict. We do much thinking, but we never make
up our minds. We let our eyes wander over many things, but we make no
choice. Life has no crisis, no culmination.</p>

<p>Now people who never decide spend their days in hoping to do so. But this
kind of life becomes a vagrancy and not a noble and illumined crusade. We
drift through our days, we do not steer, and we never arrive at any rich
and stately haven.</p>

<p>It is therefore vitally wise to &ldquo;make a vow unto the Lord.&rdquo; It is good to
pull our loose thinkings together and to &ldquo;gird up the loins of the mind.&rdquo;
Let a man, at some definite place, and at some definite moment, make the
supreme choice of his life.</p>

which dominate the common plain. There should be an upland district, where
springs are born, and where rivers of inspiration have their birth. &ldquo;I
will lift up mine eyes unto the hills.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The soul that knows no hills is sure to be oppressed with the monotony of
the road. The inspiration to do little things comes from the presence of
big things. It is amazing what dull trifles we can get through when a
radiant love is near. A noble companionship glorifies the dingiest road.
And what if that Companion be God? Then, surely, &ldquo;the common round and
daily task&rdquo; have a light thrown upon them from &ldquo;the beauty of His
countenance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The &ldquo;heavenlies&rdquo; are our salvation and our defence. &ldquo;His righteousness is
like the great mountains.&rdquo; &ldquo;The mountains bring forth peace unto His
people.&rdquo;</p>

certain kind of soil, but he also sent me the soil in which to grow it. He
sent instructions, but he also sent power. And when I am bidden to keep a
commandment I feel as though I have received the bulb but not the soil!
But is this God&#8217;s way of dealing with His people? I will read on if
perchance I may find the gift of the soil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He that abideth in Me ... the same bringeth forth much fruit.&rdquo; That is
the gift I seek. For the keeping of His commandments the Lord provides
Himself. I am not called upon to raise fruits out of the soil of my own
will, out of my own infirmity of aspiration or desire. I can rest
everything in God! I can &ldquo;abide in Him,&rdquo; and I may have the holy energies
of the Godhead to produce in me the fruits of a holy and obedient life.
The good Lord provides both the bulb and the soil.</p>

<p>It is the tragedy of life that we forget this, and seek to make a soil-bed
of our own. And thus do we suffer the calamity of fruitless labour, the
heavy drudgery of tasks beyond our strength. &ldquo;Come unto Me, all ye that
labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.&rdquo;</p>

is to be complete. No sullenness is to remain, no sulky temper which so
easily gives birth to thunder and lightning. There is to be no painful
aloofness, no assumption of a superiority which rains contempt upon the
offender. When I forgive, I am not to carry any powder forward on the
journey. I am to empty out all my explosives, all my ammunition of anger
and revenge. I am not to &ldquo;bear any grudge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I cannot meet this demand. It is altogether beyond me. I might utter words
of forgiveness, but I cannot reveal a clear, bright, blue sky without a
touch of storm brewing anywhere. But the Lord of grace can do it for me.
He can change my weather. He can create a new climate. He can &ldquo;renew a
right spirit within me,&rdquo; and in that holy atmosphere nothing shall live
which seeks to poison and destroy. Grudges shall die &ldquo;like cloud-spots in
the dawn.&rdquo; Revenge, that awful creation of the unclean, feverish soul,
shall give place to goodwill, the strong genial presence which makes its
home in the new heart.</p>

the whole. He hallowed the inch but not the mile. He would go part of the
way, but not to the end. And the peril is upon us all. We give ourselves
to the Lord, but we reserve some liberties. We offer Him our house, but
we mark some rooms &ldquo;Private.&rdquo; And that word &ldquo;Private,&rdquo; denying the Lord
admission, crucifies Him afresh. He has no joy in the house so long as any
rooms are withheld.</p>

<p>Dr. F. B. Meyer has told us how his early Christian life was marred and
his ministry paralyzed just because he had kept back one key from the
bunch of keys he had given to the Lord. Every key save one! The key of one
room kept for personal use, and the Lord shut out. And the effects of the
incomplete consecration were found in lack of power, lack of assurance,
lack of joy and peace.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;joy of the Lord&rdquo; begins when we hand over the last key. We sit with
Christ on His throne as soon as we have surrendered all our crowns, and
made Him sole and only ruler of our life and its possessions.</p>

that lured us away. And we are to show them how we found the springs of
grace, and how the Lord made Himself known to us in daily providence and
care. We are to relate His exploits, &ldquo;His wonderful dealings with the
children of men.&rdquo; We must make our life witness of God to our children,
and when their minds roam over our road they must see it radiant with the
grace and mercy of the Lord.</p>

<p>The best inheritance I can give my child is a steadfast witness of my
knowledge of God. The testimony of a light that never failed may give him
the needful wisdom when his own way becomes troubled with clouds and
darkness. And what a story it is, this story of the deeds of our gracious
God. It is full of quickening for weary and desponding souls. It is a
perfect reservoir of inspiration for those whose desire has failed, and in
whose lives the wells of impulse have become dry. Let us bring forward

</div><p>HAT is surely the worst affront we can put upon anybody. We may oppose a
man and hinder him in his work, or we may directly injure him, or we may
ignore him, and treat him as nothing. Or we may forget him! Opposition,
injury, contempt, neglect, forgetfulness! Surely this is a descending
scale, and the last is the worst. And yet we can forget the Lord God. We
can forget all His benefits. We can easily put Him out of mind. We can
live as though He were dead. &ldquo;My children have forgotten Me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>What shall we do to escape this great disaster? &ldquo;<em>Take heed to thyself!</em>&rdquo;
To take heed is to be at the helm and not asleep in the cabin. It is to
steer and not to drift. It is to keep our eyes on the compass and our
hands on the wheel. It is to know where we are going. We never
deliberately forget our Lord; we carelessly drift into it. &ldquo;Take heed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>And keep thy soul diligently.</em>&rdquo; Gardens run to seed, and ill weeds grow
apace. The fair things are crowded out, and the weed reigns everywhere. It
is ever so with my soul. If I neglect it, the flowers of holy desire and
devotion will be choked by weeds of worldliness. God will be crowded out,
and the garden of the soul will become a wilderness of neglect and sin.</p>

lightning. We recount the promises, we shut our ears to the rebukes. We
love the passages which speak of our Master&#8217;s gentleness, we turn away
from those which reveal His severity. And all this is unwise, and
therefore unhealthy. We become spiritually soft and an&aelig;mic. We lack moral
stamina. We are incapable of noble hatred and of holy scorn. We are
invertebrate, and on the evil day we are not able to stand.</p>

upon the appalling fearfulness of sin, and upon its terrific issues. At
all costs we must get rid of the spurious gentleness that holds compromise
with uncleanness, that effeminate affection which is destitute of holy
fire. We must seek the love which burns everlastingly against all sin; we
must seek the gentleness which can fiercely grip a poisonous growth and
tear it out to its last hidden root. We must seek that holy love which is
as a &ldquo;consuming fire.&rdquo;</p>

death. He offers us liberty, and he hides his chains in dazzling flowers.

The Lord&#8217;s ends are attained through very mysterious means. Sometimes the
means are in contrast to the ends. He works toward the harvest through

reaches his lovely ends through an awful mortar, where the raw material of
bone and clay is pounded into a cream. In that mortar-chamber we have no
hint of the finished ware. But be patient, even in this chamber of
affliction the ware is on the way to glory!</p>

<p>And so it is with the ministries of our Lord. He leads us through discords
into harmonies, through opposition into union, through adversities into
peace. His means of grace are processes, sometimes gentle, sometimes
severe; and our folly is to assume that we have reached His ends when we
are only on the way to them. &ldquo;The end of the Lord is very pitiful, and of

vivid as though we had never seen it before, our sympathies will never
fail. The fresh eye insures the sensitive heart. And our God&#8217;s compassions
are so new because He never becomes accustomed to our need. He always sees
it with an eye that is never dulled by the commonplace; He never becomes
blind with much seeing! We can look at a thing so often that we cease to

</div><p>AMUEL RUTHERFORD used to say that whenever he found himself in the
cellars of afflictions he used to look about for the King&#8217;s wine. He would
look for the wine-bottles of the promises and drink rich draughts of
vitalizing grace. And surely that is the best deliverance in all
affliction, to be made so spiritually exhilarant that we can rise above
it. I might be taken out of affliction, and emerge a poor slave and
weakling. I might remain in affliction, and yet be king in the seeming
servitude, &ldquo;more than conqueror&rdquo; in Christ Jesus. It is a great thing to
be led through green pastures and by still waters; I think it is a greater
thing to have a &ldquo;table prepared before me <em>in the presence of mine
enemies</em>.&rdquo; It is good to be able to sing in the sunny noon; it is better
still to be able to sing &ldquo;songs in the night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And this deliverance may always be ours in Christ Jesus. The Lord may not
smooth out our circumstances, but we may have the regal right of peace. He
may not save us from the sorrows of a newly-cut grave, but we may have the
glorious strength of the immortal hope. God will enable us to be masters
of all our circumstances, and none shall have a deadly hold upon us.</p>

<h2><em>THE MIGHT OF FRAILTY</em></h2>

<img src="images/img-t.png" width="80" height="80" alt="T" title="" />
</div><p>HAT is the wonder of wonders, that the Almighty God will use frail
humanity as the vehicles of His power, and will make Moses and Aaron shine
with reflected glory. Man can send an electric current into a fragile
carbon film and make it incandescent. He can send his voice across a
continent, and make it speak on a distant shore. And the Lord God can do
wonders compared with which these are only as the dimmest dreams. He can
send His holy power into human speech, and the words can wake the dead. He
can send His virtue into the human will, and its strength can shake the
thrones of iniquity. He can send His love into the human heart, and the
power of its affection can capture the bitterest foe.</p>

<p>And so the word &ldquo;impossible&rdquo; becomes itself impossible when the soul of
man is in fellowship with the Lord of Hosts. The pliant will becomes an
iron pillar. The weak heart becomes &ldquo;as a defended city&rdquo; when it is the
home of God. Dumb lips become the thrones of mysterious eloquence when
touched with divine inspiration.</p>

</div><p>ND thou shalt eat and be full, and thou shalt bless the Lord thy God.&rdquo;
Fulness is surely a more searching test than want. Fulness induces sleep
and forgetfulness. Many a man fights a good fight with Apollyon in the
narrow way, who lapses into sleepy indifference on the Enchanted Ground.
Men often sit down to a full table without &ldquo;grace.&rdquo; Pain cries out to God,
while boisterous health strides along in heedlessness. Yes, it is our
fulness that constitutes our direst peril. &ldquo;This was the iniquity of
Sodom, <em>fulness</em> of bread and abundance of idleness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And so our tests may come on the sunny day. A nation&#8217;s supreme tests may
come in its prosperity. The sunshine may do more damage than the
lightning. The soul may falter even in Beulah land, where &ldquo;the sun shines
night and day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Prayer must not, therefore, tarry until sickness and adversity come. We
must &ldquo;pray without ceasing&rdquo; in the cloudless noon, lest we are stricken
with &ldquo;the arrow that flieth by day.&rdquo; We must seek the eternal strength
when no apparent enemy crouches at our gate, and when our easy road is
lined with luxuriant flowers and fruit.</p>

That is the faith that prompts mighty ventures and crusades. It is faith
in God&#8217;s willingness and ability to redeem His promises. It is faith that
if I do my part He will most assuredly do His. It is faith that He cannot
possibly fail. It is faith that when He makes a promise the money is
already in the bank. It is faith that when He sends me into the wilderness
the secret harvest is already ripe from which He will give me &ldquo;daily
bread.&rdquo; It is faith that &ldquo;all things are now ready,&rdquo; and in that faith I
will face the apparently impossible task.</p>

<p>And thus the &ldquo;impossible&rdquo; leads me to the &ldquo;prepared.&rdquo; The desert leads me
to &ldquo;fields white already.&rdquo; The hard call to sacrifice leads me to the
&ldquo;lamb in the thicket.&rdquo; &ldquo;God is able,&rdquo; and He is never behind the time. The
critical need unveils His grace.</p>

<p>Faith goes out on this invincible reliance. It is &ldquo;the assurance of things
hoped for.&rdquo; And by faith it inherits these things and is rich and strong
in their possession.</p>

must not overburden the flesh.</p>

<p>And therefore am I bidden to &ldquo;<em>take heed</em>&rdquo; to myself. I must exercise
common sense, the most important of all the senses. I must put a bridle
upon my appetite, and hold it in subjection to my Lord.</p>

<p>And I must &ldquo;<em>watch</em>!&rdquo; The devil is surpassingly cunning, and, if he can,
he will mix an opiate even with the sacramental wine. He will lure me

Its energies seek out the ruined and desolate life with glorious offer of
renewal. When the Lord laid down His life the entire race found a new
beginning. Our hope is born at the Cross. It is there that &ldquo;the burden of
our sin rolls away.&rdquo; In His night we find daybreak. When He said, &ldquo;It is
finished,&rdquo; our soul could sing, &ldquo;Life is begun.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And so pilgrims gather at the Cross. Songs are heard there, the &ldquo;sweetest
ever sung by mortal tongues.&rdquo; And the power of the Cross never wanes. Its
glorious grace reaches the soul to-day as in the earliest days. It
inspires the despairing heart. It transforms the mind. It remakes the

<h2><em>SICKNESS AMONG CHRIST&#8217;S FRIENDS</em></h2>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 80px;">
<img src="images/img-a.png" width="80" height="80" alt="A" title="" />
</div><p>ND so sickness can enter the circle of the friends of the Lord. &ldquo;<em>He whom
Thou lovest is sick.</em>&rdquo; My sicknesses do not mean that I have lost His
favour. The shadow is His, as well as the sunshine. When He removes me
from the glare of boisterous health it may be because of some spiritual
fern which needs the ministry of the shade. &ldquo;<em>This sickness is ... for the
glory of God.</em>&rdquo; Something beautiful will spring out of the shadowed
seclusion, something which shall spread abroad the name and fame of God.</p>

<p>And, therefore, I do not wonder at the Lord&#8217;s delay. He did not hasten
away to the sick friend: &ldquo;<em>He abode two days still in the same place where
He was.</em>&rdquo; Shall I put it like this: the awaking bulbs were not yet ready
for the brighter light&mdash;just a little more shade! We are impatient to get
healthy; the Lord desires that we become holy. Our physical sickness is
continued in order that we may put on spiritual strength.</p>

<p>And there are others besides sick Lazarus concerned in the sickness: &ldquo;I am
glad <em>for your sakes</em> I was not there.&rdquo; The disciples were included in the
divine scheme. Their spiritual welfare was to be affected by it. Let me
ever remember that the circle affected by sickness is always wider than
the patient&#8217;s bed. And may God be glorified in all!</p>

<em>even now</em>, whatsoever Thou wilt ask of God, God will give it Thee!&rdquo; Mark
the &ldquo;even now&rdquo;! Lazarus was dead, and it was midnight in the desolate
home. But &ldquo;even now&rdquo;! Beautiful it is when a soul&#8217;s most awful crises are
the seasons of its most radiant faith! Beautiful it is when our lamp
shines steadily in the tempest, and when our spiritual confidence remains
unshaken like a gloriously rooted tree. Beautiful it is when in our
midnight men can hear the strains of the &ldquo;even now&rdquo;!</p>

<p>And let me consider the wonder of the Divine response. &ldquo;<em>I am the
resurrection and the life.</em>&rdquo; A faith like Martha&#8217;s will always win the
Saviour&#8217;s best. And here is an overwhelming best before which we can only
bow in silent homage and awe. He is the Fountain in whom the stagnant
brook shall find currency again. He is the Life in whom the fallen dead
shall rise to their feet again.</p>

<p>And what is this? &ldquo;Whosoever liveth and believeth in Me <em>shall never
die</em>!&rdquo; We shall go to sleep, but we shall never taste the bitterness of
death. In the very act of closing our material eyes we shall open our
spiritual eyes, and find ourselves at home!</p>

of sheer sympathy with the tears of others. And perhaps, too, He wept
because some of our tears were needless. If we were better men we should
know more of the love and purpose of our Lord, and perhaps many of our
tears would be dried. Still, here is the sweet and heartening evangel. He
sympathizes with my grief! Never a bitter tear is shed without my Lord
sharing the tang and the pang.</p>

<p>Here is Jesus praying! &ldquo;Father, I thank Thee that Thou hast heard Me.&rdquo;
Then it is not so much a prayer as a thanksgiving. He gives thanks for
what He is &ldquo;about to receive.&rdquo; Is this my way? Perhaps I do it before I
take a meal. Do I do it before I begin to live the day? In the morning do
I thank my God for what I am about to receive? Can I confidently give
thanks before I receive the gifts of God, before the dish-covers are
removed? Can I trust Him?</p>

<p>And here is Jesus commanding, clothed in sovereign power: &ldquo;Lazarus, come
forth!&rdquo; That is the same voice which &ldquo;in the beginning created the heavens
and the earth.&rdquo;</p>

<img src="images/img-a.png" width="80" height="80" alt="A" title="" />
</div><p>&nbsp;FEARFUL nemesis waits upon the spirit of bigotry. Oliver Wendell Holmes
has said that bigotry is like the pupil of the eye, the more light you
pour into it the more it contracts. The scribes and Pharisees became
smaller men the more the Lord revealed His glory. In the raising of
Lazarus they saw nothing of the glory of the resurrection life, nothing of
the joy of the reunited family, nothing of the gracious ministry of the
Lord! &ldquo;Darkness had blinded their eyes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And it is also the nemesis of bigotry to be bitter, cruel, and violent.
They sought to kill the Giver of life!</p>

<p>It is the ministry of light to ripen and sweeten the dispositions. &ldquo;The
fruit of the light is in all goodness.&rdquo; It is the ministry of the darkness
to make men sour and unsympathetic, and revengeful, and to so pervert the
heart as to make it a minister of poison and death.</p>

<p>And yet, how powerless is bigotry in the long run! It can no more stay the
progress of the Kingdom than King Canute could check the flowing tide!
Bigotry slew the Lord, and He rose again! And so it ever is. &ldquo;Truth
crushed to earth shall rise again; the eternal years of God are hers.&rdquo;</p>

</div><p>EATH is never a commonplace. We never become so accustomed to funerals as
not to see them. Everybody sees the mournful procession go along the
street. A momentary awe steals over the flippant thought, and for one
brief season the superficial opens into the infinite abyss.</p>

<p>And yet, while a thousand are arrested, only a few are compassionate.
There can be awe without pity; there can be interest without service. When
this humble funeral train trudged out of the city of Nain our Lord halted,
and His heart melted! There was an &ldquo;aching void,&rdquo; and He longed to fill
it. There was a bleeding, broken heart, and He yearned to stand and heal
it. He found His own joy in removing another&#8217;s tears, His own satisfaction
in another&#8217;s peace.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>The Lord hath visited His people!</em>&rdquo; That is what the people said, and I
do not wonder at the saying! And let me, too, be a humble visitor in the
troubled ways of men! Let my heart be a well of sweet compassion to all
the sons and daughters of grief! Like Barnabas, let me be &ldquo;a son of
consolation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But can I share his witness, &ldquo;<em>I know that my Redeemer liveth</em>&rdquo;? Have I a
calm assurance that my ruler is not caprice, and that my comings and
goings are not determined by unfeeling chance? When death knocked at my
door, did I know that the King had sent him? When some cherished scheme
toppled into ruin, had I any thought that the Lord&#8217;s hand was concerned in
the shaking? Even when my circumstances are dubious, and I cannot trace a
gracious purpose, do I know that my Vindicator liveth, and that some day
He will justify all the happenings of the troubled road?</p>

<p>And so let me practise meeting Him! Said a mother to me one day concerning
her long-absent boy: &ldquo;I lay a place for him at every meal! His seat is

Him in all my affairs&mdash;my choices, my pleasures, my times of business, my
season of rest? He may come just now; let His place be ready!</p>

<p>If He delay, I must not become careless. If He give me further liberty, I
must not take liberties with it. Here is the golden principle, ever to
live, ever to think, ever to work as though the Lord had already arrived.
For indeed, He has, and when the veil is rent I shall find Him at my

<p>There is <em>strength</em>. &ldquo;Put on thy strength!&rdquo; There will be no broken wills
in the golden city, and no broken hearts. No one will walk with a limp!
Everybody will go with a brave stride as to the strains of a band. And no
one will tire of living, and the inhabitant never says, &ldquo;I am sick.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And there is <em>beauty</em>. &ldquo;Put on thy beautiful garments.&rdquo; Bare strength
might not be attractive. But strength clothed in beauty is a very gracious
thing. The tender mosses on the granite make it winsome. Strength is
companionable when it is united with grace. In the golden city there will
be tender sentiment as well as rigid conviction.</p>

<p>And these glories will be our defence. A positive virtue is our best
rampart against vice. A robust health is the best protection against the

were toward the Lord how swift my progress would be! I strive to walk
after holiness, while my inclinations are in the realm of sin. And so I
need a clean mouth, with an appetite for the beautiful and the true.
&ldquo;Blessed are they that hunger after righteousness.&rdquo;</p>

power to crash through all obstacles which may impede his heavenly
progress. And such is my need. Good Lord, endow me with a will like &ldquo;an

very association may be made our temptation. The devil would rather gain

the friends of the world. What am I doing in the kingdom? Can I be
trusted? Or am I in the pay of the evil one?</p>

<p>And our Master was betrayed in the garden of prayer. In the most hallowed
place the betrayer gave the most unholy kiss. He brought his defilement
into the most awe-inspiring sanctuary the world has ever known. And so may
it be with me. I can kindle the unclean fire in the church. I can stab my
Lord when I am on my knees. While I am in apparent devotion I can be in
league with the powers of darkness.</p>

never again do I hold a cheap religion. It is in this garden that we learn
the real values of things, and come to know the price at which our
redemption was bought. No one can remain in Gethsemane and retain a

to the Divine will, the angel comes, and my soul is refreshed. The laying
down of self is the taking up of God. When I lose my will I gain the

granite here! Peter is yet loose and yielding; more like a bending reed
than an unshakable rock. A servant girl whispers, and his timid heart
flings a lie to his lips and he denies his Lord.</p>

<p>Peter denied the Master, not because he coveted money, but because he
feared men. He was not seeking crowns, but escaping frowns. He was not
clutching at a garland, but avoiding a sword. It was not avarice but
cowardice which determined his ways. He shrank from crucifixion! He saw a
possible cross, and with a great lie he passed by on the other side.</p>

betrayed by a false friend!</p>

revealed. When I watch the demeanours of Pilate and Jesus, I can see very
clearly who it is who is on the throne; Pilate wears the outer trappings
of royalty, but my Lord&#8217;s is &ldquo;the power and the glory.&rdquo; Pilate fusses
about in a little &ldquo;brief authority,&rdquo; but my Lord stands possessed of a
serene dominion. Even at Pilate&#8217;s judgment bar Jesus is the King.</p>

<p>But His kingdom is &ldquo;<em>not of this world</em>.&rdquo; And therefore this King is
unlike every other King. He seeks His possessions not by fighting, but by
&ldquo;lighting&rdquo;; not by coercion, but by constraint. His servants do not go
forth with swords, but with lamps; not to drive the peoples, but to lead
them. His visible throne is a cross, and His conquests are made in the
power of sacrifice.</p>

<p>And so His armaments are the Truth, and the Truth alone. &ldquo;<em>For this cause
came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the Truth.</em>&rdquo; When
the Truth wins and wooes, the triumph is lasting. Garlands won by the
sword perish before the evening. To be one of the King&#8217;s subjects is to
share His nature. &ldquo;Everyone that is of the truth heareth My voice.&rdquo;</p>

approach which leaves true music silent. Whether the genius of music is to
answer us or not depends upon our &ldquo;touch.&rdquo; Herod&#8217;s &ldquo;touch&rdquo; was wrong, and
there was no response. Herod was flippant, and the Eternal was dumb. And
I, too, may question a silent Lord. In the spiritual realm an idle
curiosity is never permitted to see the crown jewels. Frivolousness never

inheritance. And this it is to be the kinsman of Herod. And this, too,

<p>When I choose carnal passion before holiness, I am preferring Barabbas to
Christ. For is there any murderer so destructive as carnality? And
holiness stands waiting, ready to make me beautiful with the wondrous
garments of grace. But I spurn the angel, and open my door to the beast.</p>

<p>The devil is always soliciting my service, and the devil &ldquo;is a murderer
from the beginning.&rdquo; Have I never preferred him, and sent my Lord to be
&ldquo;crucified afresh,&rdquo; and &ldquo;put Him to an open shame&rdquo;?</p>

<p>Again let me pray&mdash;for all my unholy and unwholesome choices, for all my
preference of the murderer, forgive me, good Lord!</p>

glimpses of reality, and when she awoke her soul was troubled. &ldquo;Have thou
nothing to do with that just man!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And I, too, have mysterious warnings when I am treading perilous ways.
Sometimes the warning comes from a friend. Sometimes &ldquo;the angel of the
Lord stands in the way for an adversary.&rdquo; My conscience rings loudly like
an alarm-bell in the dead of night. Yes, the warnings are clear and
pertinent, but...!</p>

<p>Pilate ignored the warning, and handed the Lord to the revengeful will of
the priests. Pilate defiled his heart, and then he washed his hands! What
a petty attempt to escape the certain issues! And yet we have shared in
the small evasion. We have crucified the Lord, and then we wear a
crucifix. We violate the spirit, and then we do reverence to the letter.
We hand the Lord over to be crucified, and then we practise the postures
and gait of the saints. Yes, we have all sought an escape in outer
ceremony from the nemesis of our shameful deeds.</p>

<p>There must be no violent retaliation. &ldquo;<em>When He was reviled, He reviled
not again.</em>&rdquo; The fire of revenge may singe or even scorch my enemy, but it
will do far more damage to the furniture of my own soul. After every
indulgence in vengeful passion some precious personal possession has been
destroyed. The fact of the matter is, this fire cannot be kept burning
without making fuel of the priceless furnishings of the soul. &ldquo;Heat not a
furnace for your foe so hot that it do singe yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There must be a serene committal of the soul to the strong keeping of the
Eternal God. &ldquo;<em>He committed Himself to Him that judgeth righteously.</em>&rdquo;
This is the way of peace, as this is the way of victory. If ever the enemy
is to be conquered this must be the mode of the conquest. When men
persecute us, let us rest more implicitly in our God.</p>

I have bowed before Him, but it has been mock and empty homage! I have
sung: &ldquo;Crown Him Lord of all!&rdquo; but there has been no real recognition of
His sovereignty; mine has been a mock coronation. From the seat of the

standing where His believers will never stand. That was the real death,

convert His goodwill into malice, His serene beneficence into wild
revenge. And how is it with me? Are my foes able to maim my spirit as well
as my body? Do they win their end by making me a smaller man? Or am I
magnanimous even on the cross?</p>

<p>And look at our Lord in relation to the penitent thief. &ldquo;<em>To-day shalt
thou be with Me in Paradise.</em>&rdquo; There was no self-centredness in our
Saviour&#8217;s grief. He was the good Physician, even when His body was mangled
on the cross. He healed a broken heart even in the very pangs of death.
When &ldquo;there was darkness over all the earth,&rdquo; He let the light of the

than the captor. He emerged from the prison as the Lord of the prison, and
death reeled at His going. In the risen Saviour death is dethroned; he
takes his place at the footstool to do the bidding of his sovereign Lord
and King. And that empty tomb means the conquest of sin. Sin had done its
worst, and had failed. All the forces of hell had been rallied against the
Lord, and above them all He rose triumphant and glorified. A little while
ago I discovered a spring. I tried to choke it. I heaped sand and gravel
upon it; I piled stones above it! And through them all it emerged,
noiselessly and irresistibly, a radiant resurrection!</p>

<p>And so the empty tomb becomes the symbol of a thoroughfare between life in
time and life in the unshadowed Presence of our God. Death is now like a
short tunnel which is near my home; I can look through it and see the

by all who hear us tell the story of the risen Lord. &ldquo;Has He been seen of

<p>My prayers must be of &ldquo;pure gold&rdquo; if He is to meet me there. There must be
nothing vulgar about them, nothing shoddy, nothing hastily constructed,
nothing thrown up anyhow. They must be chaste and sincere, and overlaid
with pure gold.</p>

<p>My home must be of &ldquo;pure gold&rdquo; if He is to meet me there. No unclean
passion must dwell there, no carnal appetite, no defiling conversation, no
immoderateness in eating and drinking. How can the Lord sit down at such a

<p>It can be so with prayer. I may use prayer as a magic minister to protect
me from invasive ills. I do not pray because I desire fellowship with the
Father, but because I should not feel safe without it. The ark is more
than the Lord.</p>

<p>It can be so with a crucifix. A crucifix may become a mere talisman, and
so supplant the Lord. I may wear the thing and have no fellowship with the
Person. And so may it be with the Lord&#8217;s Supper. I may come to regard it
as a magic feast, which makes me immune from punishment, but not immune
from sin. It may be a minister of safety, but not of holiness.</p>

sickness and destruction. So it is with all the holy things of God: if I
dethrone them they will uncrown me.</p>

<p>It is even so with music. Unless I give it its holy sovereignty it will
become a minister of the passions, and the angel within me is mastered by
a beast. Let me read again Tennyson&#8217;s &ldquo;Palace of Sin,&rdquo; and let me
heedfully note how music becomes the instrument of ignoble sensationalism,
and aids in man&#8217;s degradation. &ldquo;But exalt her, and she shall exalt thee.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is even so with art. It is purposed to be the holy dwelling-place of
God, but I can so abuse it as to make it the agent of degradation. Instead
of hallowing the life it will debase and impoverish it.</p>

<p>I will therefore remember that, if I infringe the Divine order, I can turn

be priests and kings unto God.&rdquo; And He will prepare us to carry our ark,

nothing about Him august and sublime. And so He is not greatly praised.
The worship is thin, the thanksgivings are scanty, the supplications are
indifferent.</p>

<p>All great saints have a great God. He fills their universe. Therefore do
they move about in a fruitful awe, and everywhere there is only a thin
veil between them and His appearing. Everywhere they discern His holy
presence, as the face of a bride is dimly seen beneath her bridal veil.
And so even the common scrub of the wilderness is aflame with sacred fire:
the humble &ldquo;primrose on the rock&rdquo; becomes &ldquo;the court of Deity&rdquo;: and the
&ldquo;strength of the hills is His also&rdquo;!</p>

<p>Yes, a great God inspires great praise, and in great praise small cares
and small meannesses are utterly consumed away. When praise is mean,
anxieties multiply. Therefore let me contemplate the greatness of God in
nature and in providence, in His power, and His holiness, and His love.
Let me &ldquo;stand in awe&rdquo; before His glory: and in the fruitful reverence the
soul will be moved in acceptable praise.</p>

</div><p>HE Apostle Paul declares that benefits may be given in one of two
ways&mdash;&ldquo;<em>of necessity</em>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<em>willingly</em>.&rdquo; One is mechanical, the other is
spontaneous. I once saw a little table-fountain playing in a drawing-room,
but I heard the click of its machinery, and the charm was gone! It had to
be wound up before it would play, and at frequent periods it &ldquo;ran down.&rdquo; A
little later I saw another fountain playing on a green lawn, and it was
fed from the deep secret resources of the hills!</p>

<p>There is a generosity which is like the drawing-room fountain. If you
listen you can hear the mechanical click, and a sound of friction, arising
from murmuring and complaint. And there is a generosity which is like the
fountain that is the child of the hills. It is clear, and sweet, and
musical, and flows on through every season! One is &ldquo;of necessity&rdquo;; the
other is &ldquo;willingly.&rdquo; And &ldquo;God loveth a cheerful giver.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And prayer can be of the same two contrary orders. One prayer is
mechanical, it is hard, formal, metallic. The other is spontaneous,
forceful, and irresistible. Listen to the Pharisee&mdash;&ldquo;Lord, I thank Thee
that I am not as other men are.&rdquo; It is the click of the machine! Listen to
the publican&mdash;&ldquo;God be merciful to me, a sinner!&rdquo; It is the voice of the
deeps.</p>

</div><p>UT this is not unison: it is harmony. When an orchestra produces some
great musical masterpiece, the instruments are all of one mind, but each
makes its own individual contribution. There is variety with concordance:
each one serves every other, and the result is glorious harmony. &ldquo;By love
serve one another.&rdquo; It is love that converts membership into fraternity:
it is love that binds sons and daughters into a family.</p>

<p>Look at a field of wild-flowers. What a harmony of colour! And yet what a
variety of colours! Nothing out of place, but no sameness! All drawing
resource from the same soil, and breathing the vitalizing substance from
the same air!</p>

<p>&ldquo;And ye, being rooted and grounded in love,&rdquo; will grow up, a holy family
in the Lord. If love be the common ground the varieties in God&#8217;s family
may be infinite!</p>

<p>And so the unity which the apostle seeks is a unity of mood and
disposition. It is not a unity which repeats the exact syllables of a
common creed, but a unity which is built of common trust, and love, and
hope. It is not sameness upon the outer lips, but fellowship in the secret
place.</p>

the garland given to another. Jealousy has no festival except when she is
&ldquo;Queen of the May.&rdquo; But love thrills to another&#8217;s exaltation. She feels
the glow of another&#8217;s triumph. When another basks in favour her own &ldquo;time
of singing of birds is come!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And all this is because love has wonderful chords which vibrate to the
secret things in the souls of others. Indeed, the gift of love is just the
gift of delicate correspondence, the power of exquisite fellow-feeling,
the ability to &ldquo;rejoice with them that do rejoice, and to weep with them
that weep.&rdquo; When, therefore, the soul of another is exultant, and the
wedding-bells are ringing, love&#8217;s kindred bells ring a merry peal. When
the soul of another is depressed, and a funeral dirge is wailing, love&#8217;s
kindred chords wail in sad communion. So love can enter another&#8217;s state as
though it were her own.</p>

<p>Our Master spake condemningly of those who have lost this exquisite gift.
They have lost their power of response. &ldquo;We have piped with you, and ye
have not danced; we have mourned with you, and ye have not lamented.&rdquo; They
lived in selfish and loveless isolation. They have lost all power of
tender communion.</p>

all things new! It changes duty into delight, and statutes into songs.</p>

<p>What a magic difference love makes to a face. It at once becomes a face
illumined. Love makes the plainest face winsome and attractive. It adds
the light of heaven, and the earthly is transfigured. No cosmetics are
needed when love is in possession. She will do her own beautifying work,
and everybody will know her sign.</p>

<p>What a magic difference love makes in service! The hireling goes about his
work with heavy and reluctant feet: the lover sings and dances at his
toil. The hireling scamps his work: the lover is always adding another
touch, and is never satisfied. Just one more touch! And just another! And
so on until the good God shall say that loving &ldquo;patience has had her

With another and deeper significance the tongue is also the register of
our condition. Our words are a perfect index of our moral and spiritual
health. If our words are unclean and untrue, our souls are assuredly
sickly and diseased. A perverse tongue is never allied with a sanctified
heart. And, therefore, everyone may apply a clinical test to his own life:
&ldquo;What is the character of my speech? What do my words indicate? What do
they suggest as to the depths and background of the soul?&rdquo; &ldquo;By thy words
thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned.&rdquo;</p>

where obligation ceases, and where the moral strain may be released. The
Apostle Peter wished his Master to draw such a line in the matter of
forgiveness. &ldquo;Lord, how oft shall I forgive? Till seven times?&rdquo; He wanted
a tiny moral rule which he could apply to his brother&#8217;s conduct.</p>

<p>Not so the Lord. Our Master tells His disciple that in those spiritual
realms relations are not governed by arithmetic. We cannot, by counting,
measure off our obligations. Our repeated acts of forgiveness never bring
us nearer to the freedom of revenge. No amount of sweetness will ever
permit us to be bitter. We cannot, by being good, obtain a license to be
evil. The fact of the matter is, if our goodness is of genuine quality,
every act will more strongly dispose us to further goodness. It is the
counterfeit element in our goodness that inclines us to the opposite camp.
It is when our forgiveness is tainted that we anticipate the &ldquo;sweetness&rdquo;
of revenge.</p>

not concern Himself with symptoms, but with causes. He does not begin with
the molten lava flowing down the fair mountain slope and destroying the
vineyards. He begins with the central fires in which the lava is born. He
does not begin with uncleanness. He begins with the thoughts which produce
it. He does not begin with murder, but with the anger which causes it. He
pierces to the secret fires!</p>

<p>Now, all anger is not of sin. The Apostle Paul enjoins his readers to &ldquo;be
angry, and sin not.&rdquo; To be altogether incapable of anger would be to offer
no antagonism to the wrongs and oppressions of the world. &ldquo;Who is made to
stumble, and I burn not?&rdquo; cries the Apostle Paul. If wrong stalked abroad
with heedless feet he burned with holy passion. There is anger which is
like clean flame, clear and pure, as &ldquo;the sea of glass mingled with fire.&rdquo;
And there is anger which is like a smoky bonfire, and it pollutes while it
destroys.</p>

<p>It is the unclean anger which is of sin. It seeks revenge, not
righteousness. It seeks &ldquo;to get its own back,&rdquo; not to get the wrong-doer
back to God. It follows wrong with further wrong. It spreads the devil&#8217;s

</div><p>HIS young champion of the Lord had won many victories before he faced
Goliath. Everything depends on how I approach my supreme conflicts. If I
have been careless in smaller combats I shall fail in the larger. If I
come, wearing the garlands of triumph won in the shade, the shout of
victory is already in the air! Let me look at David&#8217;s trophies before he
removed Goliath&#8217;s head.</p>

<p>He had conquered his temper. Read Eliab&#8217;s irritating taunt in the
twenty-eighth verse, and mark the fine self-possession of the young
champion&#8217;s reply! That conquest of temper helped him when he took aim at
Goliath! There is nothing like passion for disturbing the accuracy of the
eye and the steadiness of the hand.</p>

<p>He had conquered fear. &ldquo;<em>Let no man&#8217;s heart fail because of him.</em>&rdquo; There
was no panic, there was no feverish and wasteful excitement. There was no
shouting &ldquo;to keep the spirits up!&rdquo; He was perfectly calm.</p>

<p>And he had conquered unbelief. He had a rich history of the providential
dealings of God with him, and his confidence was now unclouded and serene.
He had known the Lord&#8217;s power when he faced the bear and the lion. Now for
Goliath!</p>

<h2><em>THE MOOD OF TRIUMPH</em></h2>

<p class="center">&ldquo;<em>I come to thee in the name of the Lord of Hosts.</em>&rdquo;<br />

</div><p>HE man who comes up to his foes with this assurance will fight and win.
Reasonable confidence is one of the most important weapons in the
warrior&#8217;s armoury. Fear is always wasteful. The man who calmly expects to
win has already begun to conquer. Our mood has so much to do with our
might. And therefore does the Word of God counsel us to attend to our
dispositions, lest, having carefully collected our material implements, we
have no strength to use them.</p>

<p>And the man who comes up to his foes with holy assurance will fight with
consummate skill. He will be quite &ldquo;collected.&rdquo; All his powers will wait
upon one another, and they will move together as one. He is as
self-possessed upon the battlefield as upon parade, as undisturbed before
Goliath as before a flock of sheep! And therefore do I say that, fighting
with perfect composure, he fights with superlative skill. The right moment
is seized, the right stone is chosen, the right aim is taken, and great
Goliath is brought low.</p>

&mdash;1 <span class="smcap">Samuel</span> xvii. 55&mdash;xviii. 5.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 80px;">

</div><p>HE hour of victory is a more severe moral test than the hour of defeat.
Many a man can brave the perils of adversity who succumbs to the
seductions of prosperity. He can stand the cold better than the heat! He
is enriched by failure, but &ldquo;spoilt by success.&rdquo; To test the real quality
of a man, let us regard him just when he has slain Goliath! &ldquo;David behaved
himself wisely&rdquo;!</p>

<p>He was not &ldquo;eaten up with pride.&rdquo; He developed no &ldquo;side.&rdquo; He went among
his friends as though no Goliath had ever crossed his way. He was not for
ever recounting the triumph, and fishing for the compliments of his
audience. He &ldquo;behaved wisely.&rdquo; So many of us tarnish our victories by the
manner in which we display them. We put them into the shop-window, and
they become &ldquo;soiled goods.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And in this hour of triumph David made a noble friend. In his noonday he
found Jonathan, and their hearts were knit to each other in deep and
intimate love. It is beautiful when our victories are so nobly borne that
they introduce us into higher fellowships, and the friends of heaven
become our friends.</p>

shut my eyes, and &ldquo;make my judgment blind.&rdquo; One of the gifts of grace is
the spirit of discernment, the eyes which not only detect hidden treasure,
but hidden foes. The devil is an expert in mimicry; he can make himself
look like an angel of light. And so must I be able to discover his snares,
even when they appear as the most seductive food.</p>

<p>And if I would be like the Psalmist, I must <em>clearly recognize my great
Ally</em>. &ldquo;If it has not been the Lord, who was on our side!&rdquo; To see the Ally
on the perilous field, and to see Him on my side, gives birth to holy
confidence and song. &ldquo;The Lord is on my side, whom shall I fear?&rdquo; I must
make sure of the Ally, and &ldquo;victory is secure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And if I would be like the Psalmist, I must not omit the doxology of
praise. When the prayer is answered, I am apt to forget the praise. My
thanksgivings are not so ready as my requests. And so the apparently
conquered enemy steals in again at the door of an ungrateful heart.</p>

inside them!&rdquo; So said Thomas Carlyle. Well, look at this man.
&ldquo;<em>Strengthened in the Lord, and in the power of His might.</em>&rdquo; There is a
secret communion with the Almighty, and he draws his resources from the
Infinite. The water in my home comes from the Welsh hills; every drop was
gathered on those grand and expansive uplands. And this man&#8217;s soldierly
strength is drawn from the hills of God; every ounce of his fighting blood
comes from the veins of the Lord.</p>

<p>And mark the nature of his armoury. His weapons are dispositions. He
fights with &ldquo;truth,&rdquo; and &ldquo;righteousness,&rdquo; and &ldquo;peace,&rdquo; and &ldquo;faith,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;prayer&rdquo;! There are no implements like these. A sword will fail where a
courtesy will prevail. We can kill our enemies by kindness. And as for the
devil himself there is nothing like a grace-filled disposition for putting
him to flight! A prayerful disposition can drive him off any field, at any
hour of the day or night. &ldquo;Put on the whole armour of God.&rdquo;</p>

everywhere. Nothing allowed to usurp His throne for an hour! I was once
allowed to sit on an earthly throne for a few seconds, but even that is
not to be allowed with the throne of God. Nothing is to share His
sovereignty, even for a moment. His dominion is to be unconditional and
unbroken. &ldquo;Thou shalt have no other gods beside Me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But we have many gods we set upon His throne. We put money there, and
fame, and pleasure, and ease. Yes, we sometimes usurp God&#8217;s throne, and we
ourselves dare to sit there for days, and weeks, and years, at a time.
Self is the idol, and we enthrone it, and we fall down and worship it. But
no peace comes from such sovereignty, and no deep and vital joy. For the
real King is not dead, and He is out and about, and our poor little
monarchy is as the reign of the midge on a summer&#8217;s night. Our real
kingship is in the acknowledgment of the King of kings. When we worship
Him, and Him only, He will ask us to sit on His throne.</p>

<h2><em>A HEALTHY PALATE</em></h2>

<p class="center">&ldquo;<em>How sweet are Thy words unto my taste.</em>&rdquo;<br />

</div><p>OME people like one thing, and some another. Some people appreciate the
bitter olive; others feel it to be nauseous. Some delight in the sweetest
grapes; others feel the sweetness to be sickly. It is all a matter of
palate. Some people love the Word of the Lord; to others the reading of it
is a dreary task. To some the Bible is like a vineyard; to others it is
like a dry and tasteless meal. One takes the word of the Master, and it is
&ldquo;as honey to the mouth&rdquo;; to another the same word is as unwelcome as a
bitter drug. It is all a matter of palate.</p>

<p>But what is a man to do who has got a perverted palate, and who calls
sweet things bitter and bitter things sweet? He must get a new mouth! And
where is he to get it? Not by any ministry of his own creation; his own
endeavours will be impotent. A healthy moral palate depends upon the
purity of the heart. Our spiritual discernments are all determined by the
state of the soul. If the heart be pure, the mouth will be clean, and we
shall love God&#8217;s law. If the soul-appetite be healthy, God&#8217;s words will be
sweet unto our taste. And so does the good Lord give us new palates by
giving us new hearts. &ldquo;Create within us clean hearts, O God, and renew
right spirits within us.&rdquo;</p>

</div><p>HEN we hear the word, but do not do it, there has been a defect in our
hearing. We may listen to the word for mere entertainment. Or we may
attach a virtue to the mere act of listening to the word. We may assume
that some magical efficacy belongs to the mere reading of the word. And
all this is perverse and delusive. No listening is healthy which is not
mentally referred to obedience. We are to listen <em>with a view to
obedience</em>, with our eyes upon the very road where the obedient feet will
travel. That is to say, we are to listen with purpose, as though we were
Ambassadors receiving instructions from the King concerning some momentous
mission. Yes, we must listen with an eye on the road.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doing&rdquo; makes a new thing of &ldquo;hearing.&rdquo; The statute obeyed becomes a song.
The commandment is found to be a beatitude. The decree discloses riches of
grace. The hidden things of God are not discovered until we are treading
the path of obedience. &ldquo;And it came to pass that as he went he received
his sight.&rdquo; In the way of obedience the blind man found a new world. God
has wonderful treasures for the dutiful. The faithful discover the &ldquo;hidden
manna.&rdquo;</p>

</div><p>OW? By dwelling in God and God in us. Love is not a manufacture; it is a
fruit. It is not born of certain works; it springs out of certain
relations. It does not come from doing something; it comes from living
with Somebody. &ldquo;Abide in Me.&rdquo; That is how love is born, for &ldquo;love is of
God, and God is love.&rdquo;</p>

<p>How many people are striving who are not abiding. They live in a
manufactory, they do not live in a home. They are trying to make something
instead of to know Somebody. &ldquo;This is life, to know Thee.&rdquo; When I am
related to the Lord Jesus, when I dwell with Him, love is as surely born
as beauty and fragrance are born when my garden and the spring-time dwell
together. If we would only wisely cultivate the fellowship of Jesus,
everything else would follow in its train&mdash;all that gracious succession of
beautiful things which are called &ldquo;the fruits of the Spirit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And &ldquo;herein is our love made perfect.&rdquo; It is always growing richer,
because it is always drawing riches from the inexhaustible love of God.
How could it be otherwise? Endless resource must mean endless growth. &ldquo;Our
life is hid with Christ in God,&rdquo; and hence our love will &ldquo;grow in all
wisdom and discernment.&rdquo;</p>

of food along the way. In every emergency he shall find fresh provision;
every new need shall discover new supplies. When one store is spent,
another shall take its place. &ldquo;Thou re-storest my soul.&rdquo; In the ways of
righteousness the good Lord has appointed ample stores for the provision
of all His faithful pilgrims.</p>

</div><p>F we wish to retain &ldquo;the word of the Lord&rdquo; everything depends upon where
we keep it. If we just keep it in the mind, a leaky memory may waste the
treasure. A Chinese convert declared that he found the best way to
remember the word was to do it! The engraved word became character,
written upon the fleshy tables of the heart. He incarnated the word, and
it became a vital part of his own personality. He lived it and it lived in
him. The word became flesh. This is the only really vital &ldquo;way of
remembrance,&rdquo; to convert the word into the primary stuff of the life.</p>

<p>There is a secondary way by which we may help our apprehension of God&#8217;s
word. &ldquo;Ye shall teach them.&rdquo; Our hold upon a truth is increased while we
impart it to others. The gospel becomes more vivid as we proclaim it to
our fellow-men. We see it while we explain it. It grips us the more firmly
as we use it to grip our children. This is a great law in life. In these
matters it is literally true that memory best retains what she gives away.
A truth that is never shared is never really possessed. The word that we

No, not in these ways is love created. Love is not a work, it is a fruit.
It grows in suitable soils, and it is our part to prepare the soils. When
the conditions are congenial, love appears, just as the crocus and the
snowdrop appear in the congenial air of the spring.</p>

<p>What, then, can we do? We can seek the Lord&#8217;s society. We can think about
Him. We can read about Him. We can fill our imaginations with the grace of
His life and service. We can be much with Him, talking to Him in prayer,
singing to Him in praise, telling Him our yearnings and confessing to Him
our defeats. And love will be quietly born. For this is how love is born
between heart and heart. Two people are &ldquo;much together,&rdquo; and love is born!
And when we are much with the Lord, we are with One who already loves us
with an everlasting love. We are with One who yearns for our love and who
seeks in every way to win it. &ldquo;We love Him because He first loved us.&rdquo; And
when we truly love God, every other kind of holy love will follow. Given

<p>And thus the only way to live is by filling every moment with fidelity. We
are ready for anything when we have been faithful in everything. &ldquo;Because
thou hast been faithful in that which is least!&rdquo; That is the order in
moral and spiritual progress, and that is the road by which we climb to
the seats of the mighty. When every stone in life is &ldquo;well and truly laid&rdquo;
we are sure of a solid, holy temple in which the Lord will delight to
dwell. The quality of our greatness depends upon what we do with &ldquo;that
which is least.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><em>CALAMITY AS REVEALER</em></h2>

<p class="center">&ldquo;<em>In the year that King Uzziah died I saw the Lord.</em>&rdquo;<br />
&mdash;<span class="smcap">Isaiah</span> vi. 1-8.</p>

</div><p>E lost a hero, and he found the Lord. He feared because a great pillar
had fallen: and he found the Pillar of the universe. He thought everything
would topple into disaster, and lo! he felt the strength of the
everlasting arms. When Uzziah lived Isaiah had forgotten his Lord. He so
depended on the earthly that he had overlooked the heavenly. Uzziah
concealed his Lord as a thick veil can hide a face. And when Uzziah died,
when the earthly king passed away, the eternal King was revealed; as when
by the passing of an earth-born cloud the moon reigns radiant in the open
sky.</p>

<p>And thus it is that apparent calamity is often the minister of revelation.
The great storm clears the air, and luminous vistas come into view. The
howling wind of adversity drives away the earth-born clouds and we see the
face of God. Our sorrows prove the occasion of our visions. We see new
panoramas through our tears. Bereavement gives us spiritual surprises, and
death becomes the servant of life. And so it happens that days which began
in gloom end in revelation, and we keep their recurring anniversary with
deepening praise.</p>

tree.</em>&rdquo;<br />&mdash;<span class="smcap">Jeremiah</span> i. 7-19.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 80px;">
<img src="images/img-a.png" width="80" height="80" alt="A" title="" />
</div><p>ND through the almond tree the Lord gave the trembling young prophet the
strength of assurance. The almond tree is the first to awake from its
wintry sleep. When all other trees are held in frozen slumber the almond
blossoms are looking out on the barren world. And God is like that, awake
and vigilant. Nobody anticipates Him. Wherever Jeremiah was sent on his
prophetic mission the Lord would be there before him. Before the prophet&#8217;s
enemies could get to work the Lord was on the field. In the wintriest
circumstances of a prophet&#8217;s life God is wide awake: &ldquo;He that keepeth
Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And still the almond tree has its heartening significance for thee and me.
Our God is wide-awake. He looks out upon our wintry circumstances, and
nothing is hid from His sight. There is no unrecognized and uncounted
factor which may steal in furtively and take Him by surprise. Everything
is open. He is wide-awake on the far-off field where the isolated
missionary is ploughing his lonely furrow. He is wide-awake on the field
of common labour where some young disciple finds it hard to keep clean
hands while he earns his daily bread.</p>

</div><p>ROVIDENCE goes into details. Sometimes, in our human intercourse, we
cannot see the trees for the wood. We cannot see the individual sheep for
the flock. We cannot see the personal soul for the masses. We are blinded
by the bigness of things; we cannot see the individual blades of grass
because of the field.</p>

<p>Now God&#8217;s vision is not general, it is particular. There are no &ldquo;masses&rdquo;
to the Infinite. &ldquo;He calleth His own sheep <em>by name</em>.&rdquo; The single one is
seen as though he alone possessed the earth. When God looks at the wood He
sees every tree. When He looks at the race He sees every man.</p>

<p>And, therefore, I need not fear that &ldquo;my way is overlooked by my God.&rdquo; He
knows every turning. He knows just where the strain begins at the hill. He
knows the perils of every descent. He knows every happening along the
road. He knows every letter that came to me by this morning&#8217;s post. He
knows every visitor who knocks at the door of my life, whether the visitor
come at the high noon or at the midnight. &ldquo;There is nothing hid.&rdquo; &ldquo;The
very hairs of your head are all numbered.&rdquo;</p>

</div><p>N infirmity becomes doubly burdensome when we give it a false
interpretation. The weight of a thing is determined by our conception of
it. If I look upon my ailment as the stroke of an offended God, I wear it
like the chains of a slave. If I look upon it as the fire of the gracious
Refiner, I can calmly await the beneficent issue. It is my Lord, engaged
in chastening His jewels!</p>

<p>And so our Master first of all relieves the blind man of the false
interpretation of his infirmity. &ldquo;<em>Neither did this man sin, nor his
parents.</em>&rdquo; That lifts the sorrow out of the winter into the spring. It
sets it in the warm, sweet light of grace. It becomes transfigured. It
wears a new face, placed there in &ldquo;the light of His countenance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And then our Lord relieves the blind man of the infirmity itself. The
ministry of blindness was accomplished, and sight was given. No man is
kept in the darkness a moment longer than infinite love deems good. Our
Lord does not overlook the prison-house, and leave us there forgotten. &ldquo;He
that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep.&rdquo; So cheer thee, my
soul! The Lord is on thy side! The Miracle-worker knows His time and &ldquo;the
dreariest path, the darkest way, shall issue out in heavenly day.&rdquo;</p>

deliver me from all pious conventionalities which make me indifferent to

<p>And here is a dense prejudice which is blind to the evident. &ldquo;<em>They did

an ecclesiastical prejudice can be so opaque as to make us &ldquo;blind to

crooked world.</p>

blind, now I see.</em>&rdquo; Second, he drew his own firm inferences from the
beneficence of the work. And, in the third place, he reached his grand
conclusion. &ldquo;<em>If this man were not of God, He could do nothing.</em>&rdquo; A grand
testimony, and given by one who &ldquo;dared to stand alone!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And the witness gained a Friend. &ldquo;Jesus heard that they had cast him out,
and when He had found him....&rdquo; Our Lord is always seeking the outcasts. He
never abandons the abandoned. When the faithful witness is driven into the
wilderness he finds &ldquo;a table spread&rdquo; before him &ldquo;in the presence of his
enemies.&rdquo; The man who had recovered his sight was cast out, but on the
threshold he met his Lord!</p>

<p>And further sight was given. By the first sight he could see his parents,
by the second sight he saw the Son of God. The film was first removed from
his eyes, and then from his soul, and he saw &ldquo;the glory of the Lord.&rdquo; &ldquo;And
he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped Him.&rdquo;</p>

tumultuous crowd. A mother can hear the faint cry of her child in the
chamber above, even when the room resounds with the talk and laughter of
her guests. And our Lord heard the wail of poor Bartim&aelig;us! That lone,
sorrowful cry pierced the clamour, &ldquo;and Jesus stood still.&rdquo; My soul, cry
to Him! &ldquo;Jesus of Nazareth passeth by.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Bartim&aelig;us knew what he wanted. He merged all his petitions in one.
&ldquo;Lord, that I might receive my sight!&rdquo; And let me, too, come to my Saviour
with some great, dominant, all-commanding request. I trifle with my
Master. I ask Him for toys, for petty things, while all the time He is
waiting to give me &ldquo;unsearchable wealth,&rdquo; &ldquo;sight, riches, healing of the
mind.&rdquo; &ldquo;The Lord is great&rdquo;; and shall I add, &ldquo;and greatly to be <em>prayed</em>!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And how delicately gracious it is that our Lord should attribute the
miracle to Bartim&aelig;us himself. &ldquo;<em>Thy faith hath made thee whole!</em>&rdquo; As
though the Lord had had no share in the ministry! He makes so much of our
faith, and our endeavour, and our obedience. &ldquo;If ye had faith as a grain
of mustard-seed!&rdquo; That&#8217;s all He wants, and miracles are accomplished.</p>

<h2><em>MANY GIFTS&mdash;ONE SPIRIT</em></h2>

<p class="center">1 <span class="smcap">Corinthians</span> xii. 1-13.</p>

<img src="images/img-t.png" width="80" height="80" alt="T" title="" />
</div><p>HERE is no monotony in the workmanship of my God. The multitude of His
thoughts is like the sound of the sea, and every thought commands a new
creation. When He thinks upon me, the result is a creative touch never
again to be repeated on land or sea. And so, when the Holy Spirit is given
to the people, the ministry does not work in the suppression of
individualities, but rather in their refinement and enrichment.</p>

<p>Our gifts will be manifold, and we must not allow the difference to breed
a spirit of suspicion. Because my brother&#8217;s gift is not mine I must not
suspect his calling. To one man is given a trumpet, to another a lamp, and
to another a spade. And they are all the holy gifts of grace.</p>

<p>And thus the gifts are manifold in order that every man may find his
completeness in his brother. One man is like an eye&mdash;he is a seer of
visions! Another man is like a hand&mdash;he has the genius of practicality! He
is &ldquo;a handy man&rdquo;! One is the architect, the other is the builder. And each
requires the other, if either is to be perfected. And so, by God&#8217;s
gracious Spirit, the individual man is only a bit, a portion, and he is
intended to fit into the other bits, and so make the complete man of the
race.</p>

<h2><em>FINDING THE DEEP THINGS</em></h2>

<p class="center">&ldquo;<em>The Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of
God.</em>&rdquo;<br />&mdash;1 <span class="smcap">Corinthians</span> ii. 7-12.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 80px;">
<img src="images/img-t.png" width="80" height="80" alt="T" title="" />
</div><p>HE deep things of God cannot be discovered by unaided reason. &ldquo;<em>Eye hath
not seen:</em>&rdquo; they are not to be apprehended by the artistic vision. &ldquo;<em>Ear
hath not heard:</em>&rdquo; they are not unveiled amid the discussion of the
philosophic schools. &ldquo;<em>Neither hath entered into the heart of man:</em>&rdquo; even
poetic insight cannot discern them. All the common lights fail in this
realm. We need another illumination, even that provided by the Holy
Spirit. And the Spirit is offered unto us &ldquo;that we might know the things
that are freely given to us of God.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And here we have the reason why so many uncultured people are spiritually
wiser than many who are learned. They lack talent, but they have grace.
They lack accomplishments, but they have the Holy Ghost. They lack the
telescope, but they have the sunlight. They are not scholars, but they are
saints. They may not be theologians, but they have true religion. And so
they have &ldquo;the open vision.&rdquo; They &ldquo;walk with God,&rdquo; and &ldquo;the deep things of
God&rdquo; are made known to their souls.</p>

<p>We must put first things first. We may be busy polishing our lenses when
our primary and fundamental need is light. It is not a gift that we
require, but a Friend.</p>

<img src="images/img-i.png" width="80" height="80" alt="I" title="" />
</div><p>T is only in the spirit that real union is born. Every other kind of
union is artificial, and mechanical, and dead. We can dovetail many pieces
of wood together and make the unity of an article of furniture, but we
cannot dovetail items together and make a tree. And it is the union of a
tree that we require, a union born of indwelling life. We may join many
people together in a fellowship by the bonds of a formal creed, but the
result is only a piece of social furniture, it is not a vital communion.
There is a vast difference between a connection and a concord.</p>

<p>Many members of a family may bear the same name, may share the same blood,
may sit and eat at the same table, and yet may have no more vital union
than a handful of marbles in a boy&#8217;s pocket. But let the spirit of a
common love dwell in all their hearts and there is a family bound together
in glorious union.</p>

<p>And so it is in the spirit, and there alone, that vital union is to be
found. And here is the secret of such spiritual union. &ldquo;By one Spirit are
we all baptized into one body.&rdquo; The Spirit of God, dwelling in all our
spirits, attunes them into glorious harmony. Our lives blend with one
another in the very music of the spheres.</p>

sameness in order to gain union. I am now looking upon a scene of
surpassing loveliness. There are mountains, and sea, and grassland, and
trees, and a wide-stretching sky, and white pebbles at my feet. And a
white bird has just flown across a little bank of dark cloud. What
variety! And when I look closer the variety is infinitely multiplied.
Everything blends into everything else. Nothing is out of place.
Everything contributes to finished power and loveliness. And so it is in
the grander sphere of human life. The glory of humanity is born of the
glory of individuals, each one making his own distinctive contribution.</p>

<p>And thus we have need of one another. Every note in the organ is needed
for the full expression of noble harmony. Every instrument in the
orchestra is required unless the music is to be lame and broken. God has
endowed no two souls alike, and every soul is needed to make the music of
&ldquo;the realm of the blest.&rdquo;</p>

difference between a guide-book and a companion! Mere instructions may be
very uninspiring, and bare commandments may be very cold. Our Guide is an
inseparable Friend.</p>

<p>And how will He guide us? He will give us insight. &ldquo;He will guide you into
all truth.&rdquo; He will refine our spirits so that we may be able to
distinguish &ldquo;things that differ,&rdquo; and that so we may know the difference
between &ldquo;the holy and the profane.&rdquo; Our moral judgment is often dull and
imperceptive. And our spiritual judgment is often lacking in vigour and
penetration. And so our great Spirit-guide puts our spirits to school, and
more deeply sanctifies them, that in holiness we may have discernment.</p>

<p>And He will also give us foresight. He will enable us to interpret
circumstances, to apprehend their drift and destiny. We shall see harvests
while we are looking at seeds, whether the seeds be seeds of good or evil.
All of which means that the Holy Spirit will deliver our lives from the
governance of mere whim and caprice, and that He will make us wise with
the wisdom of God.</p>

Birmingham. When they arrived in Birmingham I asked them, among other
things, if they had seen Warwick Gaol along the road. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;we
hadn&#8217;t a glimpse of it.&rdquo; &ldquo;But it is only a field&#8217;s length from the road!&rdquo;
&ldquo;Well, we never saw it.&rdquo; Ah, but these two friends were lovers. They were
so absorbed in each other that they had no spare attention for Warwick
Gaol. Their glorious fellowship made them unresponsive to its calls. They
were otherwise engaged.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lusts of the flesh.&rdquo; That
great Companionship will make us negligent of carnal allurements. &ldquo;The
world, and the flesh, and the devil&rdquo; may stand by the wayside, and hold
their glittering wares before us, but we shall scarcely be aware of their
presence. We are otherwise engaged. We are absorbed in the &ldquo;Lover of our
souls.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This is the only real and effective way to meet temptation. We must meet
it with an occupied heart. We must have no loose and trailing affections.
We must have no vagrant, wayward thoughts. Temptation must find us engaged
with our Lover. We must &ldquo;offer no occasion to the flesh.&rdquo; Walking with the
Holy One, our elevation is our safety.</p>

choice upon the best.</p>

<p>Let me remember that &ldquo;all is not gold that glitters.&rdquo; The leaden casket is
often the shrine of the priceless scroll. The glaring and the theatrical
have often a ragged and seamy interior, and won&#8217;t bear &ldquo;looking into.&rdquo; A
man may have much display and be very lonely; he may have piles of wealth
and be destitute of joy. His libraries may cover an acre, and yet he may
have no light. And a man may have only &ldquo;a candle, and a table, and a bed,&rdquo;

</div><p>EREBY perceive we the love of God, because &ldquo;<em>He laid down His life for
us</em>.&rdquo; And the real test of any love is what it is prepared to &ldquo;lay down.&rdquo;
How much is it ready to spend? How much will it bleed? There is much
spurious love about. It lays nothing down; it only takes things up! It is
self-seeking, using the speech and accents of love. It is a &ldquo;work of the
flesh,&rdquo; which has stolen the label of a &ldquo;fruit of the Spirit.&rdquo; Love may
always be known by its expenditures, its self-crucifixions, its Calvarys.
Love is always laying down its life for others. Its pathway is always a
red road. You may track its goings by the red &ldquo;marks of the Lord Jesus.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And this is the life, the love-life, which the Lord Jesus came to create
among the children of men. It is His gracious purpose to form a spiritual
fellowship in which every member will be lovingly concerned about his
fellows&#8217; good. A real family of God would be one in which all the members
bleed for each, and each for all.</p>

<p>How can we gain this disposition of love? &ldquo;God is love.&rdquo; &ldquo;We love because
He first loved us.&rdquo; At the fountain of eternal love we too may become
lovers, becoming &ldquo;partakers of the divine nature,&rdquo; and filled with all
&ldquo;the fulness of God.&rdquo;</p>

</div><p>HIS is a surgical operation in the realm of the soul. A man has been
&ldquo;<em>overtaken in a fault</em>,&rdquo; some evil passion has pounced upon him, and he
is broken. Some holy relationship has been snapped, and he is crippled in
his moral and spiritual goings. Perhaps his affections have been broken,
or his conscience, or his will. Or perhaps he has lost his glorious hope
or the confidence of his faith. Here he is, a broken man, the victim of
his own broken vows, lame and halt in the pilgrim-way! And some surgeon is
needed to re-set the dislocation, and to make him whole again.</p>

<p>And who is to be the surgeon? &ldquo;<em>Ye which are spiritual restore such a
one.</em>&rdquo; The men who live under the control of God&#8217;s Spirit are to be the
surgeons for broken hearts and souls. When a man has fallen by reason of
sin, the Christian is to be a Good Samaritan, seeking to restore the
cripple to health and strength again. We are to kneel and minister to him,
binding up his wounds, giving him the balm and cordial of oil and wine.</p>

<p>And what is to be the spirit of the surgeon? &ldquo;The spirit of meekness.&rdquo; We
are not to be supercilious, for the &ldquo;touch&rdquo; of pride is never the minister
of healing. We are to heal as though some day we may need to be healed.</p>

was a Pharisee, and his piety was cold and mechanical. Religion had become
a bloodless obedience to lifeless rules. Men cared more about being proper
than about being holy. Modes were emphasized more than moods. An external
pose was esteemed more highly than an internal disposition. The popular
Saint lived on &ldquo;the outsides of things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then came the Life. And what will He say to the externalist? &ldquo;Ye must be
born again.&rdquo; Nothing else could He have said. If the mechanical is to
become the vital there is nothing for it but a new birth. To get from the
outside into the inside of things, from the letter into the spirit, we
need the miracle of renewal, the recreating ministry of grace.</p>

<p>And so it is to-day. The ritualistic is vitalized by the evangelistic. If
the mechanical is to become the spontaneous, there is need of the &ldquo;well of
living water, springing up unto eternal life.&rdquo; When we are born again,
ritual becomes helpful trellis for the spiritual flowers; the outward form
becomes the helpmeet of redeeming grace.</p>

hurtful circumstances are so invasive and so immediate that only God can
come between us and them. But when God gets in between we are immune.
&ldquo;Though an host should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Thou art my glory.</em>&rdquo; And that is an honour that need never be stained.
My worldly glory can be besmirched. An evil man throws mud, and my poor
reputation is gone. &ldquo;There&#8217;s always somebody ready to believe it!&rdquo; But my
glory with God, and in God&mdash;man&#8217;s mud cannot touch that fair fame! Even

His way is in the sea we cannot trace it. Mystery is part of our appointed
discipline. Uncertainty is to prepare us for a deeper assurance. The

<p>It is the old story. We are wanting God to appear in imperial glory; and

</div><p>HEN Lincoln had been assassinated, and word of the tragedy came to New
York, &ldquo;the people were in a state of mind which urges to violence.&rdquo; A man
appeared on the balcony of one of the newspaper offices, waving a small
flag, and a clear voice rang through the air: &ldquo;Fellow-citizens! Clouds and
darkness are round about Him! His pavilion is dark waters, and thick
clouds of the skies! Justice and judgment are the habitation of His
throne! Fellow-citizens, God reigns!&rdquo; It was the voice of General
Garfield.</p>

<p>That voice proclaimed the divine sovereignty, even when the heavens were
black with the menace of destruction. Lincoln had been assassinated, but
God lived! Human confusion does not annihilate His throne. God liveth!
&ldquo;The firm foundation standeth sure.&rdquo; This is the only rock to stand upon
when the clouds have gathered, and the waters are out, and the great deeps
are broken up. God&#8217;s sceptre does not fall from His grasp, nor is snatched
by alien hands. The throne abideth. Joy will rise from the apparent chaos
as springs are unsealed by the earthquake. He will bring fortune out of
misfortune; the darkness shall be the hiding-place of His grace.</p>

<h2><em>THE LAW IN THE HEART</em></h2>

<p class="center">&ldquo;<em>I will put My laws into their hearts.</em>&rdquo;<br />

<div class="figleft" style="width: 80px;">
<img src="images/img-e.png" width="80" height="80" alt="E" title="" />
</div><p>VERYTHING depends on where we carry the law of the Lord. If it only rests
in the memory, any vagrant care may snatch it away. The business of the
day may wipe it out as a sponge erases a record from a slate. A thought is
never secure until it has passed from the mind into the heart, and has
become a desire, an aspiration, a passion. When the law of God is taken
into the heart, it is no longer something merely remembered: it is
something loved. Now things that are loved have a strong defence. They are
in the &ldquo;keep&rdquo; of the castle, in the innermost custody of the stronghold.
The strength of the heart is wrapped about them, and no passing vagrant
can carry them away.</p>

<p>And this is where the good Lord is willing to put His laws. He is wishful
to put them among our loves. And the wonderful thing is this: when laws
are put among loves they change their form, and His statutes become our
songs. Laws that are loved are no longer dreadful policemen, but
compassionate friends. &ldquo;O! how I love Thy law!&rdquo; That man did not live in a
prison, he lived in a garden, and God&#8217;s will was unto him as gracious
flowers and fruits. And so shall it be unto all of us when we love the law
of the Lord.</p>

communion with the Lord in the holy place? &ldquo;He that hath clean hands.&rdquo;
These hands of mine, the symbols of conduct, the expression of the outer
life, what are they like? &ldquo;Your hands are full of blood.&rdquo; Those hands had
been busy murdering others, pillaging others, brutally ill-using their
fellow-men. We may do it in business. We may do it in conversation. We may
do it in a criminal silence. Our hands may be foul with a brother&#8217;s blood.
And men and women with hands like these cannot &ldquo;ascend into the hill of
the Lord.&rdquo; There must be no stain of an unfair and scandalous life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And a pure heart.&rdquo; We need not trouble about the hands if the heart be
clean. If all the presences that move in the heart&mdash;desires, and motives,
and sentiments, and ideals&mdash;are like white-robed angels &ldquo;without spot, or
wrinkle, or any such thing,&rdquo; everything that emerges into outer life will
share the same radiant purity. The heart expresses itself in the hands.
Character blossoms in conduct. The quality of our current coin is
determined by the quality of the metal in the mint. &ldquo;As a man thinketh in
his heart, so is he.&rdquo;</p>

can we be. Neither can law heal us after our transgressions and defeats.
The law has nothing for prodigal men but &ldquo;blackness, and darkness, and
tempest.&rdquo; It has no sound but dreaded decree, no message but menace, no
look but a frown. Who will build his house at the foot of Mount Sinai?</p>

<p>&ldquo;But ye are come unto Mount Zion.&rdquo; Our true home is not at Sinai, but at
Calvary. There is no place for the sinner at the first mount; at the
second mount there is a place for no one else. At Calvary we may find our
way back to the holiness we lost at Sinai. Through grace we may drop the
burden of our sin and begin to wear the garments of salvation. The way
back to heaven is by &ldquo;the green hill, without a city wall.&rdquo; It is a mount
that can be reached by the most exhausted pilgrim; and the one who has
&ldquo;spent all&rdquo; will assuredly find a full restoration of life at the gate of
his Saviour&#8217;s death. &ldquo;Ye are come to Jesus, the mediator of the new
covenant.&rdquo;</p>

answer to his request would have consumed him. He asked for the blazing
noon when as yet he could only bear the quiet shining of the dawn. The
good Lord lets in the light as our eyes are able to bear it. The
revelation is tempered to our growth. The pilgrim could bear a brightness
in Beulah land that he could not have borne at the wicket-gate; and the
brilliance of the entry into the celebrated city throws the splendours of
Beulah into the shade. Yes, the gracious Lord will unveil His glory as our
&ldquo;senses are exercised to receive it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My Presence shall go with thee.&rdquo; That is all the glory we need upon the
immediate road. His companionship means everything. The real glory is to
possess God; let Him show us His inheritance as it shall please Him.
Life&#8217;s glory is to &ldquo;feel Him near.&rdquo; When the loving wife feels that the
husband is in the house, and when the loving husband feels that the wife
is in the house, that is everything! The joy of each other&#8217;s presence is
the crown of married bliss. And so it is with the soul that is married to

<div class="figleft" style="width: 80px;">

</div><p>ND how does the Lord comfort us? He has a thousand different ways, and no
one can ever tell by what way the comfort will come to his soul. Sometimes
it comes by the door of memory, and sometimes by the door of hope.
Sometimes it is borne to us through the ministry of nature, and at other
times through the ministry of human speech and kindness. But always, I
think, it brings us the sense of a Presence, as though we had a great
Friend in the room, and the troubled heart gains quietness and peace. The
mist clears a little, and we have a restful assurance of our God.</p>

<p>Now comforted souls are to be comforters. They who have received benefits
of grace are to be benefactors. They who have heard the sweet music of
God&#8217;s abiding love are to sing it again to others. They who have seen the
glory are to become evangelists. We must not seek to hoard spiritual
treasure. As soon as we lock it up we begin to lose it. A mysterious moth
and rust take it away. If we do not comfort others, our own comfort will
turn again to bitterness; the clouds will lower and we shall be imprisoned
in the old woe. But the comfort which makes a comforter grows deeper and
richer every day.</p>

<h2><em>RECKONING UP THINGS</em></h2>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 80px;">
<img src="images/img-n.png" width="80" height="80" alt="N" title="" />
</div><p>UMBERING things is one of the healthful exercises of the spiritual life.
Unless we count, memory is apt to be very tricky and to snare us into
strange forgetfulness. Unless we count what we have given away, we are
very apt to exaggerate our bounty. We often think we have given when we
have only listened to appeals; the mere audience has been mistaken for
active beneficence. The remedy for all this is occasionally to count our
benevolences and see how we stand in a balance-sheet which we could
present to the Lord Himself.</p>

<p>And we must count our blessings. It is when our arithmetic fails in the
task, and when counting God&#8217;s blessings is like telling the number of the
stars, that our souls bow low before the eternal goodness, and all
murmuring dies away &ldquo;like cloud-spots in the dawn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And we must also &ldquo;number our days.&rdquo; We are wasteful with them, and we
throw them away as though they are ours in endless procession. And yet
there are only seven days in a week! A day is of immeasurable
preciousness, for what high accomplishment may it not witness? A day in
health or in sickness, spent unto God, and applied unto wisdom, will
gather treasures more precious than rubies and gold.</p>

</div><p>&nbsp;STARLING never reveals the richness of its hues until we see it in the
sunlight. A duty never discloses its beauties until we set it in the light
of the Lord. It is amazing how a dull road is transfigured when the
sunshine falls upon it! God&#8217;s grace reveals the graces in all healthy
things. Hidden lovelinesses troop out when we set them in the presence of
the Lord.</p>

<p>And so the Apostle counsels an obedience which is &ldquo;in the Lord.&rdquo; He wants
us to know how beautiful common things can be when they are linked to
Christ. And what he says about obedience he says about everything. One of
the great secrets in the teaching of Paul is expressed in just this
phrase, &ldquo;in the Lord,&rdquo; &ldquo;in Christ.&rdquo; It meant connection with a power-house
whose energy would light up all the common lamps of life&mdash;the lamps of
hope, of faith, of love, of daily labour, and of human service.</p>

<p>And this is the secret of the Christian life. We need no other; at least,
all other secrets are involved in this. If we attend to this little
preposition &ldquo;in,&rdquo; we have entry into the infinite. If we are &ldquo;in Christ,&rdquo;
we are in the kingdom of everything that endures, and we are outside
nothing but sin.</p>

of cold water,&rdquo; which it is in the power of everybody to give. The great
benefactors are the great lovers, and their coin is not that of material
money, but the wealth of the heart. A bit of affection is worth infinitely
more than the gift of a necklace of pearls. To kindle hope in a fainting
soul is far more precious than to adorn the weary pilgrim with dazzling
gems. &ldquo;He brought me heaps of presents, but I was hungering for love!&rdquo;
Such was the pathetic cry of one who was &ldquo;clothed in purple and fine
linen, and fared sumptuously every day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cups of cold water,&rdquo; simple ministries of refreshment, the love-thought,

which men covet is so often a fruit of stupefaction, the dull product of
sinful drugs, the wretched sluggishness of carnal gratification and
excess. The rest which God giveth is alive and wakeful, abounding in
tireless and fruitful service. &ldquo;Oh, rest in the Lord.&rdquo;</p>

die out of the soul. The days move with heavy feet, and duty becomes very
stale and unwelcome. If only our ears were keen enough we should hear many
a place of hollow laughter moaning with troubled and restless sighs. The
soul cannot sing when God is defied.</p>

<p>But see another effect of sin. &ldquo;<em>The earth moaneth.</em>&rdquo; That is a frequent
note in Bible teaching. The forces of nature are mysteriously conditioned
by the character of man. When man is degraded, nature is despoiled. The
beauty of the garden is checked when man has lost his crown. &ldquo;The whole

not afraid of severe measures where carnality was concerned. He would fast

with all the Lord&#8217;s children. We are too self-indulgent. It is well at
times to put the body on the cross, and crucify its cravings.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Give no occasion to the flesh.</em>&rdquo; Do not give it a chance of mastery!
And, therefore, do not feed it with illicit thought. Turn the mind away

much.</em>&rdquo;<br />&mdash;<span class="smcap">James</span> v. 13-20.</p>

</div><p>R, as Weymouth translates it, &ldquo;The heartfelt supplication of a righteous
man exerts a mighty influence.&rdquo; Prayer may be empty words, with no more
power than those empty shells which have been foisted upon the Turks in
their war with the Balkan States. Firing empty shells! That is what many
professed prayers really are; they have nothing in them, and they
accomplish nothing. They are just forged upon the lips, and they drop to
the earth as soon as they are spoken. Effectual prayers are born in the
heart; they are stocked with heart-treasure, with faith, and hope, and
desire, and holy urgency, and they go forth with power to shake the world.</p>

<p>What are my prayers like? <em>If I were God, could I listen to them?</em> Are
they mere pretences at prayer, full of nothing but sound? Is there any
reasonable ground for assuming that they can accomplish anything? Or are
my prayers weighted with sincere desire? Do they comprehend my brother&#8217;s
good as well as my own? Are they spoken in faith? Do they go forth in
great expectancy? Then do they surely &ldquo;exert a mighty influence,&rdquo; and they
become fellow-labourers with all God&#8217;s ministries of grace. The greatest
thing I can do is greatly to pray.</p>

<h2><em>GOD MY STRENGTH AND SONG</em></h2>

<p class="center">&ldquo;<em>The Lord is my strength and my song.</em>&rdquo;<br />
&mdash;<span class="smcap">Psalm</span> cxviii. 14-21.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 81px;">
<img src="images/img-y.png" width="81" height="80" alt="Y" title="" />
</div><p>ES, first of all &ldquo;my strength&rdquo; and then &ldquo;my song&rdquo;! For what song can
there be where there is languor and fainting? What brave music can be born
in an organ which is short of breath? There must first be strength if we
would have fine harmonies. And so the good Lord comes to the songless, and
with holy power He brings the gift of &ldquo;saving health.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And my song&rdquo;! For when life is healthy it instinctively breaks into song.
The happy, contented soul goes about the ways of life humming its
satisfactions to itself, and is now and again heard by the passer-by. The
Lord fills the life with instinctive music. When life is holy it becomes
musical with His praise.</p>

<p>So here I see the appointed order in Christian service. It is futile to
try to make people joyful unless we do it by seeking first to make them
strong. First the good, and then the truly happy! First the holy, and then
the musical. First God, and then the breath of His Holy Spirit, and then
&ldquo;the new song.&rdquo;</p>

has its origin in our Sovereign King. &ldquo;All our springs are in Thee.&rdquo; &ldquo;Thou

<p>&ldquo;<em>And the life was the light of men.</em>&rdquo; And what did He not light up? His
amazing rays streamed down the darkest ways of men, and illumined the
vast, sombre chambers of human circumstance. He lit up sin and showed its
true colour! He lit up sorrow, and transfigured it! He lit up duty, and
gave it a new face. He lit up common work, and glorified it. He lit up
death, and we could see through it! But, above all, He lit up God, and
&ldquo;the people that sat in darkness saw a great light.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>And the darkness apprehended it not.</em>&rdquo; The darkness could not lay hold
of it and quench it! It was not overwhelmed and eclipsed by the murkiest
fog of prejudice, or by the dingiest antagonism of sinful pride. &ldquo;The
light showeth in the darkness,&rdquo; inviolable and invincible!</p>

keen-scented to discern the essences of things, alert to perceive the
reality behind the semblance, to &ldquo;see things as they are.&rdquo; All the great
primary senses are awake, and He has knowledge of every &ldquo;secret place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>He shall smite ... with the rod of His mouth, and with the breath of His
lips shall He slay.</em>&rdquo; The spirit of light follows a crusade of holiness.
The light becomes lightning! The &ldquo;breathing,&rdquo; which cools the
fever-stricken, can also become a hot breath, which wastes and destroys
every plant of evil desire. It is an awful thing, and yet a gracious
thing, that &ldquo;our God is a consuming fire.&rdquo; It was foretold of our Lord
that He should baptize &ldquo;with fire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And this crusade of holiness is in the ministry of peace. He will burn
away all that defileth, in order that He may create a profound and
permanent fellowship. When His work is done, there will be a mingling of
apparent opposites, and antagonisms will melt into a gracious union. &ldquo;The
sucking child will play on the hole of the asp, and the weaned child shall
put his hand on the adder&#8217;s den.&rdquo;</p>

content to be &ldquo;sent into the fields to feed swine.&rdquo;</p>

entire ministry of destruction. Nothing beautiful does He destroy, nothing
winsome: only the insidious presences which are the foes of these things.
He will destroy only the pestiferous microbes which ravage the vital peace
of the soul. Our Lord is the enemy of the deadly, and therefore of &ldquo;him
that had the power of death&mdash;that is, the devil!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And in this holy ministry of destruction He can defend my soul as &ldquo;one who

to succour them that are tempted.&rdquo;</p>

to be &ldquo;out on the ocean sailing,&rdquo; singing of &ldquo;a home beyond the tide,&rdquo;
while all the time there is a piece of perilous salvage work to be done
beneath the waves. To &ldquo;follow Jesus&rdquo; is to face the hostility of scribes
and Pharisees, to offer restoring friendship to publicans and sinners, to
pray in blood-shedding in Gethsemane, to brave the derision of the brutal
mob, and to be &ldquo;ready&rdquo; for the appalling happenings on Calvary! Therefore,
following is not a light picnic; it is a possible martyrdom!</p>

wants to articulate the thought and purpose of God. He is quite content to
be hidden, like a bird in a thick bush, if only his song may be heard.</p>

<p>And in order that he may be a voice he retires into the silent solitudes
of the desert. He will listen before he speaks. Come thou, my soul, into
his secret! The air is clamorous with speech behind which there has been
no hearing. Men speak, and in their words there is no pulse of the
Infinite. In their consolations there is no balm. In their reproaches
there is no sword. Their words are empty vessels, full of sound! Let my
voice be hushed until I have heard the voice of the Highest. &ldquo;He that hath
ears to hear, let him hear.&rdquo;</p>

higher planes of being. Perhaps our Lord had reached this material
consummation, and was now on the wonderful border land, and could by
choice slip into &ldquo;the glory!&rdquo;</p>

unpolished gem! The Lord loves to go into the unlikely place, and lead
forth His saints. &ldquo;In the wilderness shall waters break out!&rdquo;</p>

<p>We must prayerfully cultivate this sacred confidence in the possibilities
of the unlikely. We can never be successful helpers of the Lord unless we
can see the diamond in the soot, and the radiant saint in the disregarded
publican. It is a most gracious art to cultivate, this of discerning a
man&#8217;s possible excellencies even in the blackness of his present shame. To
see the future best in the present worst, that is the true perception of a
child of light.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O give us eyes to see like Thee!&rdquo; Well, this is the medium of
vision:&mdash;&ldquo;Blessed are the pure in heart, for <em>they shall see</em> God,&rdquo; and
the god-like, even in the wilderness of sin. &ldquo;Anoint thine eyes with
eye-salve, that thou may&#8217;st see!&rdquo;</p>

He does not buy them with illicit gold. He does not put the glittering
crown upon the entrance-gate, and hide the cross behind the wall. No: on
the very first stage of the sacred pilgrimage there falls &ldquo;the shadow of
the Cross.&rdquo; &ldquo;<em>Let him take up his cross daily, and follow Me.</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>And yet, the Lord&#8217;s blessing is hidden in the apparent curse. In the act
of bearing the cross we increase our strength. That is the heartening
paradox of grace. Virtuous energies pass from our very burdens into our
spirits, and thus &ldquo;out of the eater comes forth meat.&rdquo; We bravely shoulder
our load, and lo! a mystic breath visits the heart, and a strange facility
attends our goings! The dead cross becomes a tree of life, and a secret
vitality renews our souls.</p>

<p>How foolish, then, O heart of mine, to avoid and evade Thy cross! Refuse
the burden, and thou declinest the strength! Ignore the duty, and thou
shalt feel no inspiration! Carefully husband thy blood, and thou shalt
remain for ever an&aelig;mic! But lose thy life, and thou shalt find it!</p>

multitudes of professing Christians who are like detached branches; their
spiritual life is ebbing away: they do not startle the beholder and cause
him to exclaim, &ldquo;How full of life!&rdquo; They do not <em>strike</em> at all! They have
no splendid &ldquo;<em>force</em> of character,&rdquo; and they therefore exercise no
arresting witness for the King. They are not &ldquo;abiding&rdquo; in the Eternal, and
therefore there is no powerful pulse from the Infinite. &ldquo;Apart from Me ye
can do nothing!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And my Lord needs me. For the vine has need of the branch! The vine
expresses itself in the branch, and comes to manifestation in leaf, and
flower, and fruit. And my Lord would manifest Himself in me, and cause my
branch to be heavy with the glorious fruits of His grace. And if I deprive
Him of the branch, and deny Him this means of expression, I am &ldquo;limiting
the Holy One of Israel.&rdquo; &ldquo;My son, give Me thine heart!&rdquo;</p>

independence! Good Lord, &ldquo;Abide in me.&rdquo;</p>

The nipping winter is essential to the green and flowery spring. No tomb,
no resurrection glory! In every life there must be a grave, and self must
be buried within it.</p>

<p>We must die to self <em>in our prayers</em>. In many prayers self is obtrusive
and aggressive from end to end. It is self, self, self! That self must be
crucified. We must make more room for others in our supplications. On our
knees the egotist must die, and the altruist be born. And &ldquo;if it die, it
bringeth forth much fruit&rdquo;! There are multitudes of professing Christians
who would experience a wonderful resurrection if they were more &ldquo;given to
hospitality&rdquo; in their communion with the Lord.</p>

<p>And if self die in our prayers, nowhere else will it be seen. That which
is truly slain when we are upon our knees will not reassert itself when we
return to common ways of work and service. And, therefore, let the corn of
wheat fall into the ground and die!</p>

dishonoured it. The spirit of worldliness, like an unclean, insurgent
flood, would enter and possess the entire realm of human life and service.
And here it converted a legitimate convenience into an unhallowed
business. It transformed a needful expedient into an unholy end. It fixed
its tables in the very courts of the Temple, and exalted the quest of
money above the worship of God.</p>

reflected in the state of the empire. If there is uncleanness in &ldquo;the holy

seeds of national instability and decay are not found in economics; they
are found in the sanctuary. &ldquo;Until I went into the sanctuary ... then
understood I!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hezekiah cleansed &ldquo;the house of the Lord.&rdquo; He cast forth the filthiness
out of the holy place. He ushered in his golden age with the reformation
of worship. He recalled exiled and white-robed Piety to her appointed
throne. He began the re-establishment of right by recognizing the rights
of God. He gave the Lord His due! All our rights are born out of our
&ldquo;being right&rdquo; with God! We begin to be rich when we cease to rob God!</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>And when the burnt offering began, the song of the Lord began also.</em>&rdquo;
That is ever so. Our real songs begin with our sacrifices. We enter the
realm of music when we enter the realm of self-surrender. A willing
offering, on a clean altar, introduces the soul into &ldquo;the joy of the

were being continually lifted from his canvas to his &ldquo;master.&rdquo; He put
nothing down which he had not first seen. He was &ldquo;seeking after&rdquo; Turner!</p>

<p>And thus it was with Josiah. His eyes were &ldquo;ever toward the Lord!&rdquo; He
studied the &ldquo;ways&rdquo; of the Lord, in order that he might incarnate them in
national life and practice. Wise doings always begin in clear seeing. We
should be far more efficient in practice if we were more diligently
assiduous in vision. It is never a waste of time to &ldquo;look unto Him.&rdquo;
Looking is a most needful part of our daily discipline. &ldquo;What I say unto
you, I say unto all, <em>Watch</em>!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And because Josiah saw the holiness of the Lord he saw the uncleanness of
the people. He had a vision of God&#8217;s holy place, and he therefore saw the
defilement of the material worship.</p>

of a lover upon his beloved! And therefore it is more than protective
vision; shall we reverently say that it is <em>inventive</em> vision, devising
gracious surprises, anticipating needs, preparing love-gifts; it is sight
which is both insight and foresight, ever inspecting and prospecting for
the loved one&#8217;s good.</p>

<p>And Solomon prayed that God&#8217;s ear might be open to the cry of His people&#8217;s
need. &ldquo;<em>Hear Thou from Thy dwelling-place.</em>&rdquo; He prayed that the house of
God might be the place of open communion. That is ever the secret of
peace, and therefore of power. If I know that I have correspondence with
the Holy One, I shall walk and work as a child of light. If God hear me,
then I can sing!</p>

<p>And Solomon prays for the grace of forgiveness. He prays for the sense of
sweet emancipation which is the gift of grace. It is the miracle of
renewal, and it ought to happen every time we open the doors of the

<p>And the permanency of this devotional mood transfigures every place. It
turns &ldquo;<em>the valley of weeping</em>&rdquo; into &ldquo;<em>a place of springs</em>.&rdquo; The colour of

Redemption was not inspired by anger, but by grace. We do not contemplate

sacrifice. At one extreme of our golden text is eternal &ldquo;love,&rdquo; and at the
other extreme is &ldquo;eternal life.&rdquo; What if the two are one? Etymologically,
&ldquo;love&rdquo; and &ldquo;life&rdquo; are akin. What if they are only two names for the same
thing?</p>

<p>To &ldquo;believe&rdquo; in the love is to receive the life. For when I believe in a
person&#8217;s love I open my doors to the lover. And to believe in the love of
God is to let the heavenly Lover in. And with love comes a wonderful
tropical air&mdash;light, and warmth, and air; and &ldquo;all things become new!&rdquo; It
is the letting in of the spring, and things which have been in wintry

</div><p>ND this is the familiar teaching, that sin is a serpent. It possesses a
deadly poison. We may give it pleasant names, but we are only ornamenting
death. A chemist might put a poison into a chaste and elegant flask, but
he has in no wise changed its nature. And when we name sin by philosophic
euphemisms, and by less exacting terminologies&mdash;such as &ldquo;cleverness,&rdquo;
&ldquo;smartness,&rdquo; or &ldquo;fault,&rdquo; or &ldquo;misfortune,&rdquo; we are only changing the flask,
and the diabolical essence remains the same.</p>

<p>And, then, sin is a serpent because it is so subtle. It creeps into my
presence almost before I know it. Its approaches are so insidious, its
expedients so full of guile. &ldquo;Therefore, I say unto all, Watch!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But in Christ the old serpent is dead! Christ &ldquo;became sin,&rdquo; and in Him sin
was crucified. The thing that bit is bitten, and its nefarious power
destroyed. But out of Christ the serpent is still busy and malicious,
claiming what he presumes to call his own.</p>

<p>Let me, then, dwell in Christ, where sin &ldquo;has no more dominion.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Whosoever believeth shall not perish but have life.&rdquo;</p>

</div><p>HIS aged apostle cannot get away from the counsels of love. All his
mental movements circle about this &ldquo;greatest thing in the world.&rdquo; Once he
would &ldquo;call down fire upon men&rdquo;; now the only fire he knows is the pure
and genial flame of love. Beautiful is it when our fires become cleaner as
we get older, when temper changes to compassion, when malice becomes
goodwill, when an ill-controlled conflagration becomes a homely fireside.</p>

<p>And all the love we acquire we must get from the altars of God. &ldquo;We love
because He first loved us.&rdquo; We can find it nowhere else. &ldquo;Love is of God.&rdquo;
Why, then, not seek it in the right place? Why seek for palms in arctic
regions, or for icebergs in the tropics? God is the country of love, and
in His deep mines there are riches &ldquo;unsearchable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And the gracious law of life is this, that every acquisition of love
increases our powers of discernment. &ldquo;He that loveth knoweth...!&rdquo; It is as
though every jewel we find gives us an extra lens for the discovery of
finer jewels still. And thus the love-life is a continual surprise, and
the surprise will be eternal, for the object of the wonder is the infinite
love of God.</p>

<p>&nbsp;WEARY woman and a weary Lord! But the Lord was only weary in body; the
woman was dry and exhausted in soul. Her heart was like some charred
chamber after a destructive fire. All its furniture was injured, and some
of it was almost burnt away. For sin had been blazing in the secret place,
and had scorched the delicacies of the spirit, and the inward satisfaction
was gone. And now she was very weary, and her daily walk had become a most
tiresome march.</p>

<p>And the Lord, with sympathetic insight, discerned the inward dryness.
There was no sound of holy contentment, no melody of joyful, spiritual
desire. There was only the cold, clammy silence of death. &ldquo;He knew what
was in man.&rdquo; And there was no &ldquo;river of water of life&rdquo; making glad the
streets of this woman&#8217;s soul.</p>

<p>And so He would bring to her the waters of spiritual satisfaction, the
holy well of eternal life. &ldquo;In the wilderness shall waters break out, and
springs in the desert.&rdquo; The Lord is about to work a miracle of grace,
changing dull pang into healing peace, and suffocated desire into soaring
fellowship with God. He is about to transform an outlawed woman into one

there were some words which would remain unspoken. But here our Master
speaks a word which only deepens the weariness of the woman, and irritates
the sore of her galling yoke. What is He doing?</p>

<p>He is seeking to change the sense of wretchedness into the sense of sin!
He is seeking to change weariness into desire! <em>He wants to make the woman
thirst!</em> And so He puts His finger upon her sin. He cannot give the
heavenly water to lips that merely ask for it. &ldquo;Sir, give me this water!&rdquo;
No, it cannot be had for the asking, only for the thirsting! And so the
gracious Lord turns the woman&#8217;s eyes upon her own sinful life, in order
that in the heat of a fierce shame she might cry out, &ldquo;I thirst for God,
for the living God!&rdquo; And sure I am that, before the Lord had done with
her, this quiet, lone cry leapt from her lips, and in immediate response
to the cry she was given a deep draught from the eternal well.</p>

<p>And, good Lord, arouse my sense of my sin that I, too, may thirst for Thy
water! Now, make me thirst for it, and in the thirst receive it!</p>

<p>And that is the law of life. &ldquo;<em>My meat is to do the will.</em>&rdquo; There is a

grief.</p>

<p>Sometimes I am foolish, and in my need I assume that the well is far away.
I knew a farmer who for a generation had carried every pail of water from
a distant well to meet the needs of his homestead. And one day he sunk a
shaft by his own house door, and to his great joy he found that the water
was waiting at his own gate! My soul, thy well is near, even here! Go not

note in the song of redemption. In that burning whiteness I discern the

<p>For the grace which flows out of sovereign holiness is a minister of the
holy Lord to make me holy. If it were not perfectly pure it would itself
be an agent of defilement. But it is &ldquo;clear as crystal,&rdquo; and therefore it
purifies and fertilizes wherever it flows. Rare trees grow upon its banks,
and grace-fruits make every season beautiful. &ldquo;Everything shall live

</div><p>HE miracle done in the body is purposed to be a symbol of a grander
miracle to be wrought in the soul. &ldquo;<em>That ye may know that the Son of Man
hath power on earth to forgive sins, then saith He...!</em>&rdquo; He heals the
paralyzed body that we may know what He can do with a paralyzed soul. He
liberates the man who is bound by palsy that we may know what He can do
for a man who is bound by guilt. We are to reason from the less to the
greater, from the material type to the spiritual reality.</p>

<p>And so it is with all my Lord&#8217;s doings in nature. They are a glorious
symbolism of what He will do in the spirit. &ldquo;That ye may know how
beautiful the Son of Man can make the heart of man, then saith He to the
seeds of the spring-time, Come forth!&rdquo; And so nature becomes a literature,
in which we see our possible inheritance in the Spirit.</p>

<p>But on our side it is all conditioned by faith. &ldquo;There He could do no
mighty works because of their unbelief.&rdquo; Even in the miracles of the
Spirit our faith must co-operate. Divine grace and human faith can
transfigure the race. &ldquo;Lord, increase our faith!&rdquo; And everywhere, let
palsied souls be delivered, and attain to glorious freedom!</p>

<img src="images/img-t.png" width="80" height="80" alt="T" title="" />
</div><p>HERE are withered limbs of the spirit as well as of the body. There are
faculties and powers which are wasting away, sacred endowments which have
lost their vital circulation. In some lives the will is a withered limb.
In others it is the conscience. In others, again, it is the affections.
These splendid moral and spiritual powers are being dried up, and they
hang comparatively limp and useless in the life. They have been withered
by sin and sinful negligence.</p>

<p>And the Lord is the healer of withered limbs. He can deal with imprisoned
affections as the warm spring deals with the river which has been locked
in ice. He can minister to a stricken will, and make it as a benumbed hand
when the circulation has been restored. He can give it grip and tenacity.
And so with all our powers. He, who is the Life, can vitalize all!</p>

<p>But here again the remnant of our withered endowment must be used in the
healing. We must surrender to the Healer. We must obey. If the Lord says:
&ldquo;Stretch forth thy hand,&rdquo; we must attempt the impossible! In this region
the impossible becomes possible in sanctified endeavour.</p>

</div><p>HAT infirmities gather together in the synagogue! What moral and
spiritual ailments are congregated in every place of worship! If the veil
of the flesh could be removed, and the inward life revealed, how we should
pity one another, and how we should pray! In how many lives should we
behold a spirit &ldquo;bound together,&rdquo; who &ldquo;could in no wise lift herself up!&rdquo;
Wills like crushed reeds, consciences like broken vocal chords, hopes like
birds with injured wings, and hearts like ruined homes!</p>

<p>But the blessed Lord still goes into the synagogue; nay, He anticipates
our coming. And He is present &ldquo;to heal the broken in heart,&rdquo; and to &ldquo;bind
up his wounds.&rdquo; His touch &ldquo;has still its ancient power.&rdquo; Still does the
gracious Master speak with authority. &ldquo;Woman, thou art loosed from thine
infirmity!&rdquo; And immediately she is &ldquo;made straight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then why do so many spiritual cripples leave the synagogue cripples still?
Because they do not give the Healer a chance. No one can remain crooked
and broken in conscience and will who grips the hand of the Lord of Life.</p>

are multitudes who cry, &ldquo;God be merciful!&rdquo; who never cry, &ldquo;God be
praised!&rdquo; &ldquo;There were none that returned to give thanks save this
Samaritan.&rdquo; Ten cleansed, and only one grateful! &ldquo;Oh, that men would
praise the Lord for His goodness!&rdquo; Many a blessing becomes stale because
it is not renewed by thanksgiving. Graces that are received ungratefully
droop like flowers deprived of rain. Yes, gratitude gives sustenance to
blessings already received. Therefore &ldquo;in everything give thanks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But emancipated lives are not only to break into praise before God, they
must exercise in confession before men. &ldquo;Let the redeemed of the Lord say
so!&rdquo; Unconfessed blessings become like the Dead Sea; refused an outlet
they lose their freshness and vitality. I am found by the Lord in order
that I, too, may be a seeker. I receive His peace in order that I may be a
peacemaker. I am comforted in order that I &ldquo;may comfort others with the
comfort wherewith I am comforted of God.&rdquo; Have you ever received a
blessing; &ldquo;pass it on!&rdquo; Tell the story of thy deliverance to the enslaved,
that he, too, may find &ldquo;the iron gate&rdquo; swing open, and so attain his
freedom.</p>

heart? Do I praise God for her heritage, and for her endowment of
spiritual glory? And do I remember her perils, especially those parts of
her walls where the defences are very thin, and can be easily broken
through? Yes, has my Church any place in my prayer, or am I robbing her of
part of her intended possessions?</p>

<p>And is the <em>entire</em> Jerusalem the subject of my supplication? Or do I only
think of a corner of it, just that part where my own little synagogue is
placed? I am a Congregationalist; do I remember the Anglican? I am an
Anglican; do I remember the Quaker? Am I thus concerned only with a small
section of Jerusalem, or does my intercession sweep the entire city?</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>They shall prosper that love thee.</em>&rdquo; I cannot be healthy if I am bereft
of fellowship. If I ignore the house of prayer I impoverish my home. The
peaceful glow of the fireside is not unrelated to the coals upon the
common altar. The sacrament is connected with my ordinary meal. To love
the Church of Christ is to become enriched with &ldquo;the fulness of Christ.&rdquo;</p>

food. He knows when my heart is tired and needs His sweet rest. &ldquo;<em>He
restoreth my soul.</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>And it sings of the God-appointed way across the hill. &ldquo;<em>He leadeth me in
paths of righteousness.</em>&rdquo; He makes the right way clear. He walks the path
of duty with me. &ldquo;<em>Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow I
will fear no evil, for Thou art with me.</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>And it sings of the feast which the Lord serves in the very midst of my
foes. &ldquo;<em>He spreadeth a table before me in the midst of mine enemies.</em>&rdquo; He
gives me the fat things of grace in the very presence of frowning
circumstances.</p>

<p>And it sings of the providence <em>which guards the rear</em>. &ldquo;Goodness and
mercy shall follow me!&rdquo; God&#8217;s grace comes between me and my yesterdays. It
cuts off the heredity from the old Adam, and no far-off plague comes nigh
my dwelling.</p>

holiness. I am sometimes amazed at His choice. He takes me into an
apparent wilderness, but I find rich herbage on the unpromising plain. And
so I would rest in His choice even when it seems adverse to my good.</p>

<p>And here is the gracious promise of gentle discrimination. &ldquo;<em>He shall
gather the lambs in His arm, and carry them in His bosom.</em>&rdquo; Says old
Trapp, &ldquo;He hath a great care of His little ones, like as He had of the
weaker tribes. In their march through the Wilderness He put a strong tribe
to two weak tribes, lest they should faint or fail.&rdquo; Yes, &ldquo;He knoweth our
frame.&rdquo; He will not lay upon us more than we can bear. At the back of
every commandment there is a promise of adequate resource. His askings are
also His enablings. The big duty means that we shall have a big lift. And
when we are tired He will lead on gently. Such is the grace and tenderness
of the Lord.</p>

show, but no satisfaction. There is much decorative china, but no
nutritious food or drink. &ldquo;Every one that drinketh of this water shall
thirst again.&rdquo; We rise from the table, and our deepest cravings are
unappeased. &ldquo;Why art thou cast down, O my soul?&rdquo; We know. We have had a
condiment, but no meat; a showy menu-card, but no reviving feast.</p>

<p>Nothing but the goodness of the Lord can satisfy the soul. Whatever else
may be on the table of life, if this be absent we shall go away unfed. We
may have money, and pleasure, and success, and fame, but they are all
delusive husks if the grace of the Lord be absent.</p>

<p>This is the real furnishing of the feast. There are vast multitudes of
things I can do without if only I have the holy bread of life in the
gracious Presence of my Lord. In this sphere it is the Guest who makes the
table! &ldquo;Thou, O Christ, art all I want!&rdquo; &ldquo;Having Him we have all things.&rdquo;
A glorious satisfaction possesses the soul, and though we may not increase
our worldly possessions, we do something better, we &ldquo;grow in grace and in
the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.&rdquo;</p>

</div><p>HERE is mutual recognition, and in that recognition there is confidence

<p>&ldquo;<em>I know my sheep.</em>&rdquo; He knows us one by one. My knowledge of the
individual wanes in proportion as the multitude is increased. The teacher
with the smaller class has the deepest intimacy with her scholars. The
individual is lost in the crowd. But not so with our Lord. There are no
&ldquo;masses&rdquo; in His sight. However big the crowd, even though it be &ldquo;a
multitude which no man can number,&rdquo; we still remain individuals, known to
the Lord by name, and face, and personal need. If thou art away from the
fold, thy face is missed, and the Shepherd is away in search of thee!</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>And I am known of mine.</em>&rdquo; And the knowledge deepens with every day&#8217;s
experience. There are false shepherds who can subtly mimic the Good
Shepherd, and in my early discipleship I am liable to be deceived. The
devil himself can array himself like a shepherd, and imitate the very
tones of the Lord. Therefore must I watch, and ever watch. But here is my
hope and inspiration. Every day I spend with my Good Shepherd sharpens my
discernments, enables me to see through the outer show of things, and to
discriminate between the false and the true.</p>

Everything which concerns thy redemption and my redemption has been

defence. All other ramparts are vulnerable. They are the happy
hunting-ground of the ravages of time; they fail in the crisis; they are
the sure victims of moth and rust. But spirituality keeps me from
childhood to age, and its shields are invincible, even in the hour of
death. &ldquo;There shall no evil befall thee.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Exalt her, and she shall promote thee.</em>&rdquo; She will lead me in the paths
of progress. Every day she will lead me to new conquests, and in
constantly enriching character I shall move towards life&#8217;s appointed goal.
Holiness is the only success worth having. Other successes are like lamps
whose trembling flames are blown out in the first gusty, stormy night.
&ldquo;But the path of the just is as a shining light that shineth more and more
even unto perfect day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>She shall give to thine head an ornament of grace.</em>&rdquo; Yes, and her
adornments are always beautiful. No beauty ever steals into the human face
comparable with the delicate presence of spirituality. It makes plain
features lovely, and transfigures them with &ldquo;the glory of the Lord.&rdquo;</p>

<img src="images/img-a.png" width="80" height="80" alt="A" title="" />
</div><p>&nbsp;MAN may measure his growth in grace by his growing delight in the speech
of the Lord. When His words are unwelcome in my ears, when they are an
intrusion which mars my pleasures, it is clear I am still in the far
country of revolt. But if His words make &ldquo;music in my ears,&rdquo; if the Lord&#8217;s
conversation is the very marrow of the feast, then I have entered into the
circle of His intimate friends. When His words taste sweet, even with a
bare board, I am &ldquo;in heavenly places with Christ.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And how can I attain unto this spiritual delight? Well, first of all I
must make &ldquo;<em>His testimonies my meditations.</em>&rdquo; Our doctors tell us that the
only way to taste the real savour of food is to masticate it well. Bolted
food never unlocks its essences. And meditation is just mental
mastication. To &ldquo;turn the word over&rdquo; in my mind will help to disburden its
treasure.</p>

<p>And then I must diligently put the word into practice. &ldquo;<em>I have not
departed from Thy judgments.</em>&rdquo; There is nothing like obedience for setting
free a spiritual essence. &ldquo;The secret of the Lord is with them that fear
Him.&rdquo;</p>

</div><p>ND so I must go into my heart if I would make a true estimate of my gains
and losses. The calculation is not to be made in my bank-books, or as I
stride over my broad acres, or inspect my well-filled barns. These are the
mere outsides of things, and do not enter into the real balance-sheet of
my life. We can no more estimate the success of a life by methods like
these than we can adjudge an oil-painting by the sense of smell.</p>

<p>What is my stock of godliness? That is one of the test questions. What are
my treasures of contentment? What about peace and joy, and hallowed and
blessed carelessness? How much pure laughter rings in my life? How much
bird-music is heard in the chambers of my heart? Is the note of praise to
be found in the streets of my soul? Am I rich in these things or
pathetically poor? &ldquo;By these things men live,&rdquo; and therefore of these
things will I make my balance-sheet and reckon up my gains.</p>

want of proportion. I think more of pretty window curtains than of fresh
air, more of &ldquo;nice&rdquo; wallpaper than of the moving pageant of the skies. I
magnify the immediate desire and minimize the ultimate goal. And so
&ldquo;things do not come right!&rdquo; How can they when the apportionment is so
perverse, when everything is topsy-turvy? If I want things to be firm and
durable I must revere the Divine order, and must put first things first.
&ldquo;<em>Seek ye first the kingdom of God and His righteousness.</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>And, therefore, I must seek holiness before success. I am to esteem
holiness with apparent failure as infinitely better than success with
stain and shame.</p>

<p>I must seek character before reputation. The applause of the world must be
as nothing compared with the approbation of God. The favouring &ldquo;voice from
heaven&rdquo; must be sweeter to my ears than the noisy cheers of the crowd.</p>

<p>And I must seek righteousness before quietness. The way of disturbance is
sometimes the way to peace. I must not be so concerned for a quiet life as
for a life that is &ldquo;right with God.&rdquo;</p>

besought Him</em>.&rdquo; In such apparently fragile things can mighty revolutions
be born! &ldquo;Prayer,&rdquo; said Tennyson, &ldquo;opens the sluice-gates between us and
the Infinite.&rdquo; It brings the frail wire into contact with the battery. It
links together man and God.</p>

<p>Prayer was corroborated by belief. &ldquo;<em>The man believed the word that Jesus
spake unto him.</em>&rdquo; By our faith we cut the channels along which the healing
energy will flow. Faith &ldquo;prepares the way of the Lord.&rdquo; Our faith is
purposed to be a fellow-laborer with grace, and, if faith be absent, grace
&ldquo;can do no mighty works.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The healing begins with the faith. &ldquo;<em>It was at the same hour in which ...
he himself believed.</em>&rdquo; These &ldquo;coincidences&rdquo; are inevitable happenings in
the realm of the Spirit. When we offer the believing prayer, God&#8217;s mighty
energies begin to besiege the life for which the prayer is made. Mr.
Cornaby, the Methodist missionary, declares how conscious he is in
far-away China when someone is interceding for him in the home-land! The
power possesses him in vitalizing flood! Hudson Taylor&#8217;s mother shuts
herself in a little room to pray, and eighty miles away her son is
converted.</p>

His gracious &ldquo;extra&rdquo; is given when our own resources are exhausted. We
must do our best before our Master will do His miracle. We must &ldquo;fill the
water-pots with water&rdquo;! We must bring &ldquo;the five loaves and two fishes&rdquo;! We
must &ldquo;let down the net&rdquo;! We must be willing &ldquo;to be made whole,&rdquo; and we
must make the effort to rise! Yes, the Lord will have my best.</p>

<p>Our Lord transforms our best into His better. He changes water into wine.
He turns the handful of seed into a harvest. Our aspirations become
inspirations. Our willings become magnetic with the mystic power of grace.
Our bread becomes sacramental, and He Himself is revealed to us at the
feast. Our ordinary converse becomes a Divine fellowship, and &ldquo;our hearts

transformations still! &ldquo;The best is yet to be.&rdquo; &ldquo;Dreams cannot picture a

responsively to another man&#8217;s need. We can measure our likeness to the
Lord by the range of our sensitiveness to the world&#8217;s sorrow and pain. Our
God is the &ldquo;Father of <em>pities</em>&rdquo;; He is sensitive in every direction, no
side is numb, and we are putting on His likeness in proportion as we
attain an all-round responsiveness to the cries of human need.</p>

<p>And here we have <em>the grace of humility</em>. &ldquo;I am not worthy!&rdquo; Our pride
always blocks &ldquo;the way of the Lord.&rdquo; Our humility makes us porous to the
Divine. The &ldquo;poor in spirit&rdquo; are already in the kingdom, and the gracious
powers of the kingdom are commanded to attend their bidding.</p>

<p>And here we have <em>the grace of faith</em>. &ldquo;Only say the word!&rdquo; The centurion
conceives the Lord&#8217;s words as soldiers attending on the Lord&#8217;s will. Let
one be spoken, and at once the mission is executed. And so it is. &ldquo;The

steady trust of the ruler was not shaken by the rude flippancy of the
artificial mourners, and his daughter was brought from the dead. &ldquo;This is
the victory that overcometh, even our faith.&rdquo; Everything bows, like
fragile reeds, before the march of a victorious faith. Scorn, and hatred,
and all manner of devilry, and death itself, all lose their power in the
presence of a belief which remains steady and steadfast. &ldquo;Said I not unto
thee that, if thou wouldst believe, thou shouldst see the glory of God?&rdquo;</p>

<p>And what an infinite reservoir of power is waiting to be tapped by the
hand of faith! A ruler believes and his daughter is vitalized. A poor
woman, bent and broken, reaches out her thin, frail hand, and lo! she is
erect and graceful as the pine! And &ldquo;my sufficiency is of God!&rdquo; All that I
may need is in the same wonderful reservoir of grace. That healing flood

from the disciples that He might cast it away again for ever? Did He use
it that He might reveal its ugliness, and so banish it from human speech?
As Jesus and His disciples came along the road the Master walked before
them. &ldquo;And behold, a Canaanitish woman came out from those borders!&rdquo; And
the disciples whispered to one another, &ldquo;Here comes one of the dogs!&rdquo; And
the Master overheard it, and His tender spirit grieved. And there and then
He resolved to help the woman and at the same time cleanse the men.</p>

<p>Is there not therefore something half-ironical in our Saviour&#8217;s use of the
word? When He spake of the woman as a &ldquo;dog,&rdquo; and of the disciples as &ldquo;the
children,&rdquo; would there not be something significant in His very looks and
tones? These cold, unfeeling men &ldquo;the children,&rdquo; and this tender yearning
woman the &ldquo;dog&rdquo;!</p>

<p>When the Lord used the disciples&#8217; word they began to be ashamed, and in
the fire of their shame their self-conceit was consumed. He turned with
impatient longing to the woman, &ldquo;O, woman, great is thy faith; be it unto
thee even as thou wilt.&rdquo;</p>

unseen. Faith sucks the energy out of splendid ideals, and incorporates it
in present and immediate life. Faith unfolds the eternal in the moment,
the infinite in the trifle, the divine in the commonplace. Faith
incorporates God and man. Yes, faith gives substance to &ldquo;things hoped
for,&rdquo; it brings them out of the air, and gives them reality and movement
in the hard and common ways of earth and time.</p>

<p>And faith is also &ldquo;<em>the test of things not seen</em>.&rdquo; By a test faith gains a
conquest. By an experiment faith acquires an experience. By a great
speculation faith makes a great discovery. &ldquo;Try me now herewith, and prove
Me!&rdquo; It is an invitation to humble and sincere assumption. Try if it
works! Make a hallowed experiment with the powers of grace.</p>

stage of spiritual babyhood. &ldquo;Ye are yet babes!&rdquo; Belief which is never
oxygenated by open confession can never nourish the soul into vigorous and
exhilarant health.</p>

<p>But there is a belief which expresses and confirms itself in confession.
&ldquo;<em>With the mouth confession is made unto salvation.</em>&rdquo; Such confession is a
means of moral and spiritual health. And confession in the early days
meant risk, venture which exposed the life to the shedding of blood. It
meant a frank defiance of the world, and an eager challenge of the devil.
And it is on such fields of open encounter for the Lord that muscle is
made, and the soul goes &ldquo;from strength to strength,&rdquo; and &ldquo;from glory to
glory.&rdquo;</p>

<p>My soul, art thou secretly ashamed of thy Lord? Art thou afraid to &ldquo;lift
high His royal banner&rdquo;? Then thou wilt always be as a feather-bed soldier,

keeps the mind in perpetual unrest, and a troubled mind soon makes the
body old. The real nourisher of the body is a quiet and radiant soul. But
let the soul be in chaos, and the body will soon be a ruin.</p>

<p>And here, too, is the healthy act of confession. &ldquo;<em>I acknowledged my sin
unto Thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid.</em>&rdquo; He retained no single germ
of the whole unclean brood. He brought them out into the light one by one,
as though he were emptying a noisome kennel. He brought them out, and
named them, in the awful Presence of the Lord.</p>

<p>And here is the ministry of forgiveness, and therefore the miracle of
restored health. Let me mark the rich variety of the descriptive words.
&ldquo;<em>Forgiven!</em>&rdquo; &ldquo;<em>Covered!</em>&rdquo; &ldquo;<em>Imputed not!</em>&rdquo; It is all removed and

the snare, that I regard my criticisms and condemnations of other people
as signs of my own innocence. This is the last refinement in temptation,
and multitudes fall before its power.</p>

<p>The way to moral and spiritual health is to direct my criticisms upon
myself. I must stand in the dock, and hear the grave indictment of my own
soul. Unless I pass through the second chapter of Romans I can never enter
the fifth and sixth, and still less the glorious forgiveness of the
eighth. &ldquo;There is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ
Jesus.&rdquo; I pass into that warm, cheery light through the cold road of

kinsmen of these ancient people are found in our own time. Men still fear
one God and serve another.</p>

<p>But something is vitally wrong when men can divorce their fear from their
obedience. And the beginning of the wrong is in the fear itself. &ldquo;Fear,&rdquo;
as used in this passage, is a counterfeit coin, which does not ring true
to the truth. It means only the payment of outward respect, a formal
recognition, a passing nod which we give on the way to something better.
It is a mere skin courtesy behind which there is no beating heart; a
hollow convention in which there is no deep and sacred awe.</p>

<p>But the real &ldquo;fear of God&rdquo; is a spiritual mood in which virtue thrives, an
atmosphere in which holy living is quite inevitable. &ldquo;The fear of the Lord
is <em>clean</em>.&rdquo; It is not lip-worship, but heart-homage, a reverence in which
the soul is always found upon its knees. And so &ldquo;the fear of the Lord is
to hate evil&rdquo;; it is an indignant repulsion from all that is hateful to
God. It is the sharing of the Spirit of the Lord. There cannot be any true
fear where the soul does not worship &ldquo;in spirit and in truth.&rdquo;</p>

them in the light. But all need severe treatment; they must be torn, fibre
from fibre, and reduced to rags.</p>

radiant sky.</p>

<p>And He will &ldquo;<em>wash me throughly from mine iniquity</em>.&rdquo; Yes, and that not

white in holiness.</p>

<p>So will He give me &ldquo;<em>a clean heart</em>&rdquo;; so will He &ldquo;<em>renew a right spirit
within me</em>.&rdquo; The very atmosphere of my life shall be as the air after
deluges of cleansing rain. It shall be sweet, and clean, and clear! I

<h2><em>THE SENSE OF WANT</em></h2>

<p class="center">&ldquo;<em>This man went down to his house justified rather than the
other.</em>&rdquo;<br />&mdash;<span class="smcap">Luke</span> xviii. 9-14.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 80px;">
<img src="images/img-t.png" width="80" height="80" alt="T" title="" />
</div><p>HE Master sets the Pharisee and publican in contrast, and His judgment
goes against the man who has made some progress in moral attainments, and
favours the man who has no victories to show, but only a hunger for
victory. The dissatisfied sinner is preferred to the self-satisfied saint.
The Pharisee had gained an inch, but had lost his sense of the continent.
The publican had not pegged out an inch of moral claim, but he had an
overwhelming sense of the untrodden universe.</p>

<p>So this, I think, is the teaching for me. We are justified by the penitent
sense of want and not by the boastful sense of possession. Our sense of
lack is the measure of our hope, and our measure of hope determines the
poverty or fulness of our communion with the Lord. The Pharisee had no
&ldquo;beyond,&rdquo; no realm of admiration, no hope! Aspiration was dead, and
therefore inspiration had ceased. Our possibilities nestle in our
cravings.</p>

rejoicings.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Who healeth all thy diseases.</em>&rdquo; He takes in hand the foul complaints
which I acquired in &ldquo;the far country,&rdquo; and with His powerful medicines,
and His wonderful &ldquo;bread of life,&rdquo; He drives the foul things from my soul.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Who redeemeth thy life from destruction.</em>&rdquo; Yes, with His own blood He
buys me back from a midnight servitude, strikes every chain and shackle
from my limbs, and makes me dance in &ldquo;the glorious liberty of the children
of God.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Who crowneth thee with loving-kindness and tender mercy.</em>&rdquo; He encircles
me with the invulnerable army of His own love. Henceforth if the devil
would get at me he must deal with God. &ldquo;As the mountains are round about
Jerusalem, so the Lord is round about His people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Who satisfieth thy mouth with good things.</em>&rdquo; He sets before me a
glorious table, and enlivens my spirits with glorious fellowship. That so
I can be no other than &ldquo;satisfied,&rdquo; and my heart is at rest in the Lord.

</div><p>UCH a divine assurance ought to make me perfectly quiet in spirit.
Restlessness in a Christian always spells disloyalty. The uncertainty is
born of suspicion. There is a rift in the faith, and the disturbing breath
of the devil blows through, and destroys my peace. If I am sure of my
great Ally, my heart will not be troubled, neither will it be afraid.</p>

<p>And such a divine assurance ought to make me bold in will and majestic in
labour. I ought to be inventive in chivalrous enterprise, and I ought to
covet the hardest parts of the field. If the mighty Ally will never fail,
I should never be afraid of the marshalled hosts of wickedness. &ldquo;One with
God is in a majority.&rdquo; &ldquo;He always wins who sides with God.&rdquo; &ldquo;The Lord is
on my side, whom shall I fear?&rdquo;</p>

<p>And such a divine assurance ought to give me a kingly demeanour. The
members of the Court acquire a certain stateliness by their lofty
fellowship. And, surely, one who walks with God should be characterized by
something of the Divine glory, and men should know that his acquaintances
are found in the courts of heaven.</p>

&ldquo;He that is faithful in that which is least, the same also is great.&rdquo;</p>

It culminated upon Calvary, but it was bleeding all along the road! It was
a fellow-feeling with all the pangs and sorrows of the race. And a pity
that bleeds is a pity that heals. &ldquo;In His love and in His pity He redeemed
us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And the multitude is round about us still, and the people are in peril of
fainting by the way. There is the multitude of misfortune, the children of
disadvantage, who never seem to have come to their own. And there is the
multitude of outcasts, the vast army of publicans and sinners. And there
are the bewildering multitudes of Africa, and India, and China, and they
have &ldquo;nothing to eat&rdquo;!</p>

<p>How do I regard them? Do I share the compassion of the Lord? Do I exercise
a sensitive and sanctified imagination, and enter somewhat into the pangs
of their cravings? My Lord calls for my help. &ldquo;How many loaves have ye?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Bring out all you have! Consecrate your entire resources! Put your all
upon the altar of sacrifice!&rdquo; And in reply to the call can I humbly and

Am I an evil leaven, like the Pharisees, or a holy leaven like the Lord?
When little children feed on my presence do they grow in strength and
beauty? Or do they become relaxed and demoralized? Who will feed upon me
to-day, and what will be the end of it?</p>

<p>If I would have my life to be as hallowed and hallowing leaven I must
regularly feed upon the Bread of Life. If I am sustained by the Lord, I
too shall be a sustainer of all who aspire after a true and holy life. My
very character will itself become heavenly bread, and men will be
nourished by it even when I am unconscious of the ministry. When they have
spent a brief hour in my company they will go away refreshed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lord, evermore give us this bread!&rdquo; So feed us with Thyself that we may
share Thy nature. Let &ldquo;virtue&rdquo; go forth from us, and let it be as holy
bread to all who are heavy-laden, and ready to faint.</p>

&ldquo;commanded&rdquo; to offer hospitality! It is once again &ldquo;the impossible&rdquo; which
is set before us. It would have been a dull commonplace to have fed the
prophet from the overflowing larder of the rich man&#8217;s palace. But to work
from an almost empty cupboard! That is the surprising way of the Lord. He

events turn on seeming trifles, and to make poverty the minister of &ldquo;the

wealth.&rdquo; It matters nothing what the wealth may be&mdash;material substance,
mental skill, or business sagacity. It becomes unhallowed power when we
attach our own label to it, and erase the name of God.</p>

<p>This man dedicated his substance, and the hunger of his fellows was
appeased. That is a great principle in human life. One man&#8217;s satisfaction

Such a remembrance keeps my soul in the realm of grace. I am so inclined
to proclaim my personal rights rather than glorify the favour of God, so
inclined to exhibit my own prowess rather than God&#8217;s most gracious bounty.
And whenever I lose the sense of grace I become a usurper and take the
throne. Our salvation is &ldquo;not of works, lest any man should boast.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And such a remembrance would keep my soul in the mood of humility.
&ldquo;Nothing in my hands I bring.&rdquo; I can no more claim the glory of salvation
than a child, who has cut a shallow trench on the sands, can claim the
glory of initiating the roll of the ocean-tide. I owe all my desires and
all my hopes and all my present attainments to the boundless goodness of
God.</p>

<p>And such a remembrance would keep my soul in the dispensation of love. I
cannot quietly and steadily contemplate the goodness of the Lord without
my soul being kindled into loving response. Without high contemplations
love smoulders, and will eventually die out. But God&#8217;s goodness inflames

there is too much asking and too little taking. If it were only rightly
regarded, prayer is companionship as well as petition, and companionship
is literally significant of the sharing of bread. In every season of
communion a part must be assigned to the taking of the things for which we
have prayed. &ldquo;<em>Receive ye</em> the Holy Ghost.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And there is <em>assimilation</em>. We must &ldquo;eat&rdquo; as well as &ldquo;take.&rdquo; It is in the
exercises of obedience that we digest and incorporate the bread of life.
Without our obedience the living Lord never becomes &ldquo;part of ourselves.&rdquo;
We never &ldquo;become one in the bundle of life&rdquo; with the Lord our God. And
truth which is not assimilated becomes a drug. Instead of being a &ldquo;savour
of life unto life,&rdquo; it becomes a &ldquo;savour of death unto death.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And there is <em>vitalization</em>. The assimilated bread of life makes
everything alive. Every faculty in my being feels the touch of divine

</div><p>Y Lord is &ldquo;the fountain of life.&rdquo; &ldquo;This life is in His Son.&rdquo; The springs
are nowhere else&mdash;not in elaborate theologies, or in ethical ideals, or in
literary masterpieces, or in music or art. &ldquo;In Him was life.&rdquo; It is so
easy to forget the medicinal spring amid the distractions of the
fashionable spa. There are some healing waters at Scarborough, but they
have been almost &ldquo;crowded out&rdquo; by bands and entertainments. It is possible
that the secondary ministries of the Church may crowd out the Church&#8217;s
Lord. I do not object to the entertainment if only it opens out on to the
Spring!</p>

<p>To have the Son is to have life. Nothing else is needed. &ldquo;Thou, O Christ,
art all I want.&rdquo; Ritualisms, and ecclesiasticisms, and formal theologies
are not requisite. We can be saved without an academic knowledge of &ldquo;the
plan of salvation.&rdquo; Many a gamekeeper&#8217;s little child knows all the roads
on the estate, although she would be quite &ldquo;at sea&rdquo; in explaining &ldquo;the
plan of the estate&rdquo; which hangs in the house of the steward. &ldquo;This is life
eternal, to know Thee and Jesus Christ whom Thou hast sent.&rdquo;</p>

</div><p>HE man who has been fed with the &ldquo;bread of life&rdquo; must remain &ldquo;in the

sanctification is not to be gained by withdrawal and retreat. At the best,
that would be a holiness sickly and an&aelig;mic, a coddled virtue devoid of
firm muscle and iron nerve. Our Lord purposes a holiness which shall wear
white robes in the streets, and shine like virgin snow in the market, and
keep itself chivalrous and stately in the common fellowships of men.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the world,&rdquo; but &ldquo;<em>not of the world</em>.&rdquo; The man who is fed on &ldquo;the bread
of life&rdquo; is endowed with powers of resistance against &ldquo;the noisome
pestilence.&rdquo; The germs of worldly epidemics find no nutriment in him. &ldquo;The
prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in Me.&rdquo; When an evil microbe
finds no foothold it withers away. If I am not &ldquo;of the world&rdquo; I shall
quite naturally and instinctively be able to resist &ldquo;all the wiles of the
devil.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And my Lord purposes me to have this positive, masculine holiness in order
&ldquo;<em>that the world may believe</em>.&rdquo; He wants disciples who will arrest the
world by their glorious health, and by their invincible moral defences. He
wants my purity to advertise His grace; He wants my faith to increase &ldquo;the
household of the faith.&rdquo;</p>

sentence out of his own experience. How much grace can our unbelief
withstand? The Lord had made the rock like unto a spring of water, and yet
these people believed not! What has He done for thee and me? Let us
retrace the pilgrimage of our own years. Let us recall the blessings by
the way&mdash;the streams in the desert, the pillar of fire that led us in the
night. And yet what is the quality of our faith? It is often weak and
reluctant, riddled with timidities, or moth-eaten with worldly ease. It is
not mighty and daring, riding forth every morning like a chivalrous knight
to inevitable conquest. It creeps along, like Mr. Halting, and Miss
Much-Afraid, and Mr. Little-Faith.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He marvelled at their unbelief.&rdquo; The Lord Jesus wondered that men and
women, seeing what they had seen, did not immediately spring to the life
and service of faith. Perhaps we do not give time for faith to be born!
Perhaps we do not see because we do not look. Perhaps we are blind to His
mercies and are therefore dead to the faith. And therefore, perhaps, our
first prayer should be, &ldquo;Lord, that I might receive my sight,&rdquo; and then
the prayer, &ldquo;Lord, increase my faith.&rdquo;</p>

questions our pride is soon humbled, for the limits of our knowledge and
power are speedily reached. The mist is very close to our doors, and in a
very few steps we are lost on a trackless moor. Who can trace the real
springs of a tear and lay his hand on the emotion that gave it birth? Who
can lead us into the bright realm where smiles are born? Who knoweth the
way of a frown, or who can uncover the secrets of fear? No living man can
explain his own breathing, or can unravel the mysterious decree which
moves his own finger!</p>

<p>And as there is so much mystery, it must be surely true that mystery is a
very gracious thing. Uncertainty is the divine ministry of blessedness. If
it were not so, He would have told us! &ldquo;I have many things to say unto
you, but ye cannot bear them now.&rdquo; If it were best for us that the mist
should be removed, He would roll it up like a garment and give us the
light of unclouded day. But the mist remains, the home of blessing. &ldquo;He

to speak of going into his garden &ldquo;to see what the Lord is doing.&rdquo; He
would stand on the top of Highgate Hill on a blustering night &ldquo;to watch
the goings of the Lord in the storm.&rdquo; And all this means that to James
Smetham creation was not merely a single event, but a <em>process</em> whose
countless events are still going on. He watched his Lord at work! Every
sunset was a new creation from the Almighty Maker&#8217;s hands.</p>

<p>To many of us the Creator is remote from His works. He is not immediately
near. And so He no longer &ldquo;walks in the garden in the cool of the day.&rdquo;
The garden is no longer a holy place. Let us recover the sacredness of
things. Let us &ldquo;practise the presence of God.&rdquo; Let us link His love and

</div><p>RAISE ye the Lord.&rdquo; And the Psalmist calls upon the creation to join in
the anthem. And that is the gracious purpose of our God, that the world
should be filled with harmonious praise. It is His will that the character
of man should harmonize with the flowers of the field, that the beauty of
his habits should blend with the glories of the sunrise, and that his
speech and laughter should mingle with the songs of birds and with the
melody of flowing streams. But man is too often a discord in creation. The
flowers put him to shame. The birds make him sound harsh and jarring. He
is &ldquo;out of tune.&rdquo;</p>

<p>What then? &ldquo;Tune my heart to sing Thy praise.&rdquo; We must bring the broken
strings, the rusted strings, the jarring strings to the Repairer and Tuner
of the soul. It is the glad ministry of His grace to re-awaken silent
chords, to restore broken harps, to &ldquo;put new songs&rdquo; in our mouths. He will
make us the kinsfolk of all things bright and beautiful. We shall &ldquo;go

words. &ldquo;He remembereth us in our low estate.&rdquo; &ldquo;I have many things to say
unto you, but ye cannot bear them now.&rdquo; &ldquo;He will not permit you to be
tempted above that ye are able.&rdquo; The burden is suited to our strength. The
revelation is determined by our experience. The pace is regulated by our
years. &ldquo;He carrieth the lambs in His arms.&rdquo; He &ldquo;leads on softly.&rdquo; Nothing
is done in ignorance. &ldquo;The Lord is mindful of His own. He remembereth His
children.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And so I must practise the belief in God&#8217;s compassionate nearness. In my
childhood I used to sing &ldquo;There&#8217;s a Friend for little children, Above the
bright blue sky.&rdquo; I know better now. He is nearer to me than I can dream.
I used to sing &ldquo;There is a happy land, Far, far away.&rdquo; Now I sing, &ldquo;There
is a happy land, <em>Not</em> far away.&rdquo; The good Father and His home are not in
some remote realm. They are very, very near to me, and He knows all about

Such is the question I heard Dr. Parker ask as he preached upon these
words. And he took up a handful of flowers which he had upon the pulpit,
and said: &ldquo;These flowers were gathered for me by little hands in a
Devonshire lane. Did I need them? No. Did I want them?... Your little girl
kissed you before you left for business this morning. Did you need it?...
Did you want it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>And so Almightiness may not need our weakness, but the loving Father wants
His children. &ldquo;We are His offspring.&rdquo; Our Father delights in the love of
His children. The Saviour said to a Samaritan woman, &ldquo;Give Me to drink.&rdquo;
And perhaps it is within the scope of our holy privilege to refresh the
heart of our Lord. Perhaps we can give Him to drink of the well of our
affections, and He will see of &ldquo;the travail of His soul and be
satisfied.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 80px;">
<img src="images/img-t.png" width="80" height="80" alt="T" title="" />
</div><p>HAT is surely a superlative honour! &ldquo;I have created him for My glory.&rdquo; I
stood before one of Turner&#8217;s paintings, and a man of fine judgment said to
me, &ldquo;That is Turner&#8217;s glory!&rdquo; He meant that in that picture the genius and
the power and the grace of Turner were most abundantly expressed. And it
is the will of God that man should express His glory, and by his
righteousness and goodness witness to the great Creator&#8217;s power and love.
Amid all the wonders and sublimities of earth, and sky, and sea, man is to
be the Almighty&#8217;s &ldquo;glory.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The contrast is pathetic when we turn from the Creator&#8217;s purpose to our
immediate life. There is so much that is shameful, crooked, and perverse.
There is little or nothing of &ldquo;glory.&rdquo; But, blessed be God! the purpose
abides, and the Creator&#8217;s work goes on. In His redemptive grace He has
made provision for marred work, for spoilt and perverted life. &ldquo;The
crooked shall be made straight.&rdquo; &ldquo;I will bring again that which is out of
the way.&rdquo; &ldquo;Where sin abounds grace doth much more abound.&rdquo;</p>

&ldquo;And so shall we be ever with the Lord.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And so the range of three score years and ten is not the limit of our
life. Our life is not a land-locked lake enclosed within the shore-lines
of seventy years. It is an arm of the sea, and where the shore-lines seem
to meet in old age they open out into the infinite. And so we must build
for those larger waters. We must lay our life plans on the scale of the
infinite, not as though we were only pilgrims of time, but as children of

</div><p>OD is our refuge and strength.&rdquo; And in the varied conflicts and perils
of life we need both these resources. We need the &ldquo;refuge.&rdquo; There are
times when our mightiest warfare is to lie passive, to shelter quietly in
the strong defences of our God. Our finest strategy is sometimes to &ldquo;rest
in the Lord and wait.&rdquo; We can slay some of our enemies by leaving them
alone. We can &ldquo;starve them out.&rdquo; They can be weakened and beaten by sheer
neglect. We feed their strength, and give them favoured chances, if we go
out and face them actively, &ldquo;marching as to war.&rdquo; The best way is to hide,
and keep quiet; and &ldquo;God is our refuge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But we also need the &ldquo;strength.&rdquo; This is positive equipment for active
service. The defensive is changed to the offensive, and in the &ldquo;strength&rdquo;
of the Lord we advance against the foe. We &ldquo;ride abroad, redressing human
wrongs.&rdquo; We &ldquo;tread upon the lion and the adder, the young lion and the
dragon we trample under foot.&rdquo; We meet our enemy on the open field, and we
slay him in his pride!</p>

<p>And so our God is our resource in the double warfare of active and passive
crusade. In Him we can take refuge, and the enemy withers. In Him we can
find fighting strength, and the enemy is overthrown.</p>

graciousness of the Lord&#8217;s call. They are like the two sides of the same
shield. They answer each other as voice and echo. When I move in obedience
the Lord moves in inspiration. He never lets me go on my own charges. &ldquo;All
things are now ready.&rdquo; Before He makes me hunger the bread is prepared.
Before I thirst the water is at hand. Before He calls me He has opened
springs in difficult places and arbours of rest along the road. When Abram
set out from his own country the Lord went before him.</p>

<p>And so I need not fear the arduous call. The very measure of its
difficulty is also the measure of the riches of the divine provisions. &ldquo;As

often are before that land is reached! But God&#8217;s windings are never
wasteful and purposeless. The apparent deviations are always gracious
preparations. We are taken out of the way in order that we may the more
richly reach our end. George Pilkington yearned to go to the foreign
field, and God sent him to a dairy farm in Ireland. But the Irish dairy
farm proved to be on the way to Uganda; and all the experience and
knowledge which Pilkington picked up in this strange business proved
invaluable when he reached his appointed field. &ldquo;He bringeth the blind by
a way that they know not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So I will remember that the &ldquo;short cut&rdquo; is not always the finest road.
God&#8217;s round-about ways are filled with heavenly treasure. Every winding is

performed beneath great domes acquire a stately and appropriate manner.
The vergers in our great cathedrals have a dignified stride. It is not
otherwise with men who consciously live under the power of vast
relationships. Princes of royal blood have a certain great &ldquo;air&rdquo; about
them. The consciousness of noble kinships has an expansive influence upon
the soul. The Jews felt its influence when they called to mind &ldquo;our Father
Abraham.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So is it with men and women of glorious kinships in the realm of faith.
Their souls expand in the vast and exalted relations. &ldquo;The children of
faith&rdquo; have vital communion with all the spiritual princes and princesses
of countless years. They have blood-relationship with the patriarchs, and
psalmists, and prophets, and they dwell &ldquo;in heavenly places&rdquo; with Paul,
and Augustine, and Luther, and Wesley.</p>

<p>Surely, such exalted kinship should influence our very stride, and set its

</div><p>ATTHEW was very weary, and the all-seeing Lord read the signs of his
spiritual dissatisfaction and unrest. As Jesus &ldquo;passed by&rdquo; nothing escaped
His watchful eye. He saw a look in Matthew&#8217;s eye as of some caged creature
longing for freedom. Matthew&#8217;s office, the contempt of his fellows, and
perhaps his own self-contempt held him in imprisoning disquietude. The
Lord knew it all, and one word from Him and the iron gate was open, and
the prisoner was free! &ldquo;Follow Me! And he left all, rose up, and followed
Him.&rdquo; With the Lord&#8217;s command was conveyed the ability to obey, and
Matthew stepped into &ldquo;the glorious liberty of the children of God.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And this is the Master&#8217;s way. His calls are always equipments. Every
received commandment is also the vehicle of requisite grace. God&#8217;s decrees
are also promises, nay, they are immediate endowments. If we reverently
open one of His callings we shall find it a store-house of needed
strength.</p>

<p>And therefore we need not fear the calls of the Lord. They are not the
harsh commandments of a tyrant, they are the loving invitations of a
friend. If we obey them we shall taste the grace of them, and &ldquo;His
statutes will become our songs.&rdquo;</p>

radiant triumph. Strengthen your will in his glorious persistence.</p>

history. I can turn to the yesterdays for light and quickening. &ldquo;Do ye not
remember the miracle of the loaves?&rdquo; Yes, I can recall the grace that met
me in my need, the power that made the crooked straight and the rough

</div><p>HAT was where Saul began to go wrong. When quest ceases, conquests cease.
&ldquo;He inquired not&rdquo;; and this meant loss of light. God will be inquired
after. He insists that we draw up the blinds if we would receive the
light. If we board up our windows He will not drive the gentle rays
through our hindrance. We must ask if we would have. The discipline of
inquiry fits us for the counsel of the Lord.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He inquired not&rdquo;; and this meant loss of sight. When light fails, sight
fails. The ponies in our pits become blind. When a spiritual power is not
exercised in the heavenly, it is deprived of its appointed functions. And
the tragedy is this, that the blind are deceived into thinking that they
still retain their sight. &ldquo;Ye say, we see!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He inquired not&rdquo;; and this meant loss of might. For &ldquo;the light of life&rdquo;
is not only illumination; it is inspiration too. It is both light and
heat; it confers guidance and dynamic. When a man, therefore, refuses the
light he becomes a weakling, and he will meet with disaster in the first
tempestuous day.</p>

</div><p>F two men are at the wheel with opposing notions of direction and
destiny, how will it fare with the boat? If an orchestra have two
conductors both wielding their batons at the same time and with
conflicting conceptions of the score, what will become of the band? And a
man whose mind is like that of two men flirting with contrary ideals at
the same time will live a life &ldquo;all sixes and sevens,&rdquo; and nothing will
move to purposeful and definite issues. If the mind flirt with Satan and
Christ, life will be filled with disastrous instability and confusion.</p>

<p>The first thing we need, therefore, for influential and impressive living
is unanimity. Unanimity in the mind is the primary factor in a forceful
life. To bring &ldquo;all that is within me&rdquo; into concord, to make every
instrument of the soul bow to one conductor, to lead all the powers into
homage to the Lord&mdash;this is the unanimity which assures the perfection of
holiness. &ldquo;Unite my heart to fear Thy name.&rdquo; That is the mood which wins
life&#8217;s prize, &ldquo;the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.&rdquo;</p>

ungirdled, entangles the feet, or is caught by the wind and hinders one&#8217;s
goings. And therefore the wearer binds the loose attire together with a
girdle, and makes it firm and compact about his body. And loose principles
can be more dangerous than loose garments. Indefinite opinions, caught by
the passing wind of popular caprice, are both a peril and a burden. Many
people go through life with loose beliefs and purposes, and they never
arrive at any glorious goal. &ldquo;Let your loins be girded about.&rdquo; Bind your
loose thinkings together with the girdle of truth into firm and saving
conviction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>And your lights burning.</em>&rdquo;</p>

flame, like a brilliant lighthouse on a dangerous shore. Let the light of
love be burning, like a lamp which sends its friendly, cheery beams to the
pilgrims of the night. &ldquo;Our sufficiency is of God,&rdquo; and the oil of grace

<p>So a mighty consciousness expresses itself in lowly service. In our
ignorance we should have assumed that divinity would have moved only in
planetary orbits, and would have overlooked the petty streets and ways of
men. But here the Lord of Glory girds Himself with the apron of the slave,
and almightiness addresses itself to menial service.</p>

<p>And that is the test of an expanding consciousness. We may be sure that we
are growing smaller when we begin to disparage humble services. We may be
sure we are growing larger when we love the ministries that never cry or
lift their voices in the streets. When a man begins to despise the
&ldquo;towel,&rdquo; he is losing his kingly dignity, and is resigning his place on

of pieces of rock or lumps of soil having been crumbled into the finest
powder. Have I not sometimes heard the phrase&mdash;&ldquo;He&#8217;s just a lump of
pride&rdquo;? Well, that pride has to be broken down into the finest powder,
until not a bit of stubborn self-conceit remains. And then the contrite
become the humble! Our gracious Lord has sometimes to use heavy hammers in
the destruction of this hard and stony pride: the shock of calamity, the
battering of disappointment and defeat! Our pride <em>must</em> be ground to
powder. Then He will come in and dwell with us!</p>

<p>And what then? He will &ldquo;<em>revive the spirit of the humble, and revive the
heart of the contrite ones</em>.&rdquo; Our broken pride shall be as broken soil in
which our Lord will grow the flowers and fruits of the Spirit. The death
of pride shall be followed by a revival of all things sweet and beautiful.

contrast between His standard and the standards of the world! The world
measures greatness by money, or eloquence, or intellectual skill, or even
by prowess on the field of battle. But here is the Lord&#8217;s
standard&mdash;&ldquo;<em>Whosoever, therefore, shall humble himself as this little
child, the same is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Those people are greatest who are most like God. We become partakers of
the Divine nature through a child-like relationship to God. The grace and
power of God pour into our souls when we wait upon Him like a little
child.</p>

<p>Child-likeness opens the doors and windows to the incoming of the
Almighty. The child-like is the trustful, and no barriers of cynical
suspicion block the channels of spiritual communion. And the child-like is
the docile, and no boulders of arrogance or self-conceit block the channel
of the invigorating waters of life. And so the child-like become the
God-like, and, of course, they are the greatest among the sons of men. The
little child enshrines the secret of the God-man, and we should be
infinitely wise if we had the little child always in our midst.</p>

man, and he rises in &ldquo;the chief seat,&rdquo; and amid loud hurrahs he responds
to the toast of his health.</p>

<p>Yes, &ldquo;push&rdquo; is the word of the world, but &ldquo;pull&rdquo; is the word of the Lord,
and between the two there is the difference of darkness and light. &ldquo;Push&rdquo;

&ldquo;Bear ye one another&#8217;s burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ.&rdquo;</p>

yourselves ensamples to the flock.</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>The only truly imperial purple is the robe of humility. Any other sort of
attire may appear to be kingly, but it has none of the glorious
significance which belongs to our sovereign Lord. When a man puts on the
robe of pride, he immediately belittles his manhood. When a man puts on
the robe of humility, he becomes a greater man.</p>

<p>But humility is more than an imperial robe, it is a complete armour. It is
fine for defence! The devil cannot get at the man who is &ldquo;clothed in
humility.&rdquo; There is no chink or crevice through which his deadly rapier
can pierce. And it is equally fine for offence! Wearing this armour we can
go out &ldquo;redressing human wrongs.&rdquo; The stroke of pride is ever futile. When

money shuts us in. Let me cry unto the Lord. He is a wonderful Friend in
the tight corner, and He will bring my feet into &ldquo;a large place.&rdquo;</p>

</div><p>HIS is an unutterable mystery, that a man can close his life against God.
&ldquo;<em>Israel would have none of Me.</em>&rdquo; We can shut out God as we can shut out
the pure air. We can bar His entrance just as we can exclude the light
from the chamber. And then the pity is, we can deceive ourselves into
believing that the air is perfectly fresh and that the room is flooded
with light. We lose our fine discernment, and we call evil good, and the
darkness we call day. If we &ldquo;refuse to have God&rdquo; in our thoughts God gives
us over to a &ldquo;reprobate mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And it is an equally unutterable mystery that a man can open his life to
the entertainment of Almighty God. &ldquo;I will dwell with them!&rdquo; That is my
supreme honour, that the Lord will be my guest. I can &ldquo;hearken&rdquo; to Him,
and &ldquo;talk&rdquo; to Him, and &ldquo;walk&rdquo; with Him. And He offers me protection. He
will &ldquo;subdue my enemies.&rdquo; And He offers me unfailing provision. The Guest
becomes the Host! I put my little upon the table, and lo! I find that &ldquo;the
cruse of oil fails not, and the meal in the barrel is not consumed!&rdquo;</p>

</div><p>N my university days at Edinburgh there was a young medical student named
Macfarlane. He was one of our finest athletes, and everybody liked him.
One day he was stricken with typhoid, which proved fatal. Macfarlane in
his days of boisterous health had neglected his Lord, and when one of his
friends, visiting him in his sickness, led his thoughts to the Saviour, he
turned and said, &ldquo;But wouldn&#8217;t it be a shabby thing to turn to Christ
now?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied his friend, &ldquo;it will be a shabby thing, but it will
be shabbier not to turn to Him at all!&rdquo; And I believe that poor Macfarlane
turned his shame-filled soul to the Lord.</p>

<p>But it is shabby to offer our Lord the mere dregs in life&#8217;s cup. It is
shabby to offer Him the mere hull of the boat when the storms of passion
have carried its serviceableness away. Let me offer Him my best, my finest
equipment, my youth! Let me offer Him the best, and give Him the helm when
I am just setting sail and life abounds in golden promise! &ldquo;Remember now
thy Creator in the days of thy youth.&rdquo;</p>

to be satisfied if only we bring them a little way along the road. If we
get them to pray! If we get them to attend the Lord&#8217;s house! If we get
them to be truthful and gentle! All of which is unspeakably good. It is a
blessed thing to be in &ldquo;the ways of Zion&rdquo;; it is a far more blessed thing
to be in the palace with Zion&#8217;s King and Lord. When we are dealing with
little children, every road must lead to Jesus, and not until the road is
trodden and we arrive at Him must we think our ministry accomplished.</p>

<p>And, therefore, if I am talking to the little ones about Samuel, or David,
or Paul, I must always see the short lane which leads to the Lord. &ldquo;Suffer
the little children to come unto <em>Me</em>!&rdquo; And once they really own Him, we
may trust their instincts for the rest. The heart in the child will leap
to the love of the Lord, &ldquo;for of such is the Kingdom of Heaven.&rdquo; When a
little one sees the Saviour, it is &ldquo;love at first sight&rdquo;!</p>

than electricity, and always besieging the gates of the soul, or
ministering to its manifold needs. Love is the greatest force in the
world.</p>

<p>And the &ldquo;Lord&#8217;s own&rdquo; are taken into the inner circle of intimacy, where
the deepest secrets dwell. We are not kept on the door-step, or left
standing in the hall, or limited to one or two &ldquo;public rooms&rdquo;; we are
privileged to enter the King&#8217;s privacy, and be nourished at the King&#8217;s

He has heard of the Father. We have &ldquo;the glorious liberty of <em>the

are infirm and sickly, and sometimes we do not offer them to Him until
they are quite &ldquo;worn out.&rdquo; It is infinitely better to offer them even then
than never to offer them at all. But it is best of all to offer our bodies
to our Lord when they are strong, and vigorous, and serviceable, and when
they can be used in the strenuous places of the field.</p>

<p>And so let me appoint a daily consecration service, and let me every

Let me look upon my body as a church, and let the service of consecration
continue all day long. &ldquo;Know ye not that your bodies are the temples of

convert them into foes. Malachi teaches me that rejected sunshine becomes
like a burning oven. The Epistle to the Hebrews teaches me that rejected
love becomes &ldquo;a consuming fire.&rdquo; Holiness nourishes virtue, it withers
vice. If I offer my Lord a tender aspiration, His breath wooes it like the
balmy air of the spring; if I come before Him with the weeds of ignoble
dispositions, He blights them as with the nipping of the frost.</p>

<p>And is it not well, for thee and me, that our Lord is thus fiercely
hostile to our sins? Is not this &ldquo;consuming fire&rdquo; the friend of my soul?
May I not pray: Burn on, burn on, pure flame, until all the refuse and
rubbish of my life are utterly consumed; burn on, burn on, until fierce
flame becomes mild light, flinging its genial radiance over a transfigured

We may listen to the philosopher as he spins his subtle theories and
weaves his systematic webs, but the meshes he has woven are not fine
enough to catch &ldquo;the deep things of God.&rdquo; Poetry fails! &ldquo;<em>Neither hath it
entered into the heart of man to conceive.</em>&rdquo; Poetic imagination may
stretch her wings, and soar, but she fails to enter the guest-chamber of
the Lord, and take an inventory of &ldquo;the things prepared.&rdquo; All these

reveal them. The men have been made in the smaller issues which go before.
We march to our crises by a gradient, every step of which is a moral
decision. The interior of the tree is secretly eaten away by white ants;
the tempest reveals and completes the destruction.</p>

<p>And I would learn from Peter&#8217;s denial the cumulative power of sins. One
sin widens the road for a bigger one to follow. The second denial will be
more vehement than the first. The third will add the element of blasphemy.
Yes, every sin is a miner and sapper for a larger army in the rear. It not
only does its own work, it prepares the way for its successor.</p>

<p>But I will connect this &ldquo;dark betrayal night&rdquo; with that sweet
after-morning when the Lord and His denier met face to face by the lake.

fishing, but the power of the resurrection went with him.</p>

<p>This action of Simon Peter&#8217;s is the only true test of the reality of any
spiritual experience. How does it fit me for ordinary affairs? A spiritual
festival should do for the soul what a day on the hills does for the

Peter&#8217;s love was not yet purified, and it indulged itself in loud and
empty boasts. True love never blusters and brawls. It is like a stream of
water flowing silently underground, and secretly bathing the roots of
things, and keeping their heads fresh, and cool, and sweet. The boast has
now dropped out of the love! It is now ashamed of words! &ldquo;Lord, Thou
knowest that I love Thee!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yes, true love expresses itself, not in clamorous boastfulness, but in
quiet services. It ministers to the Lord&#8217;s sheep and the Lord&#8217;s lambs. It
spends its strength on the mountains, &ldquo;seeking that which is lost,&rdquo; and it
does this in the darkness, where there is no applauding crowd. The true
lover does not ask for some dramatic scene where he can die for the
beloved; he delights in obscure services, the feeding and tending of the
sheep of the flock.</p>

<p>But the love that does the humbler thing will be ready for the greater
sacrifice whenever the day shall demand it. Some day the once boastful
denier shall lay down his life for his Saviour, and through martyrdom he

land.</em>&rdquo; As I write these words, the sun has just slipped out from behind
the cloud. It has been there all the time, but the ministry of the cloud
was needed, and so it appeared as though there would be sun and spring no
more. &ldquo;Behind a frowning Providence He hides a smiling face.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And it tells me of the Divine forgiveness. &ldquo;<em>Thou hast forgiven the
iniquity of Thy people.</em>&rdquo; Yes, when the sun appears, He loosens the frozen
earth and streams, and turns the bondage into liberty. The soul that was
imprisoned in freezing guilt attains a joyous freedom.</p>

<p>And it tells me of revival. &ldquo;<em>Wilt Thou not revive us again?</em>&rdquo; It is the
next step in the returning spring. The sleeping, benumbed things will all
awake! &ldquo;The flowers appear on the earth.&rdquo; Where grace reigns, graces
spring! Forgiveness is attended by renewal, and the wilderness begins to
&ldquo;blossom like the rose.&rdquo;</p>

wonder by his majestic boldness! His one resource is now the risen Christ,

before an accusing maid; now he stands undaunted before the rulers of the
earth. How has it all come about?</p>

<p>He has been to the empty tomb. The awe of the resurrection is upon his
spirit. Through the once blind cul-de-sac of the grave he has seen the
King and the great white throne.</p>

<p>And he has been by the lake on the morning of reconciliation. The live
coal from the altar of his Lord&#8217;s love has touched him and has purged away
the uncleanness of his denial.</p>

<p>And he has been in the upper room at Pentecost, and the mighty Spirit has
come upon him like wind and flame, endowing him with forceful and
enthusiastic character. Now he can dare for God, now he can work for God,
now he can burn for God! And this is how he has been transformed.</p>

affrights us. We are dismayed by numbers. We forget the quiet, pervasive,

<p>And it is this buoyancy, this elasticity, this springiness that the Lord
is waiting to impart to the souls of His children, so that they may move
along the ways of life with the light steps of the fawn.</p>

<p>Some of us move with very heavy feet. There is little of the fawn about us
as we go along the road. There is reluctance in our obedience. There is a
frown in our homage. Our benevolence is graceless, and there is no charm
in our piety, and no rapture in our praise. We are the victims of &ldquo;the
spirit of heaviness.&rdquo; And yet here is the word which tells us that God
will make our feet &ldquo;like hinds&#8217; feet.&rdquo; He will give us exhilaration and

buoyancy for the steepest hills. Let us seek the inspiration of the Lord.

forge the armour for myself I should be in despair. But I can go to the
armoury of grace, where there is an ever-open door and abundant welcome
for every person who fain would be a knight-errant of the Lord. The Lord
will provide me with perfect equipment suitable for every kind of contest
which may meet me along the road. There are no favourites among the
pilgrims except, perhaps, the neediest, and to them is given &ldquo;more
abundant honour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sometimes one of the Lord&#8217;s knights loses one piece of armour, and he must
at once repair to the armoury. Perhaps he has lost his helmet, or his
shield, or even his breastplate, and the enemy has discovered his
vulnerable place. We must never continue our journey imperfectly armed.
The evil one will ignore the pieces we have, and he will direct all his
attack where there is no defence. Back to the armoury! Back to the

such recognition and such glory may be the wonderful lot of thee and me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Abraham, my friend.&rdquo; The Lord of hosts found delight in human
friendships. He comes in to sup with us. He drinks of the cup of our

</div><p>N this portion of this great prayer I discern the unalterable mode in
which nations and individuals recover their moral health and strength.</p>

<p>How do they lose it? Two words tell the story. They &ldquo;<em>sin</em>&rdquo; and are
&ldquo;<em>smitten</em>.&rdquo; It is an inevitable sequence. Every sin is the minister of
disease. Sometimes we can see it, when the disease flaunts its flags in
the flesh; lust and drunkenness have glaring placards, and we know what is
going on within. But even when sin makes no visible mark the wasting
process is at work. It is as true of falsehood as of drunkenness, of
treachery as of lust. &ldquo;Evil shall slay the wicked.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And how do we recover our lost estate? There are three words which tell
the story. &ldquo;<em>Turn!</em>&rdquo; &ldquo;<em>Confess!</em>&rdquo; &ldquo;<em>Make supplication!</em>&rdquo; The words need no
exposition. I must turn my face to my despised and neglected Lord; I must
tell them all about my miserable revolt, and I must humbly crave for His
restoring grace.</p>

<p>And the answer is sure. Such humble exercise sets the joy-bells ringing,
and the rich forgiveness of the Lord fills the soul with peace. &ldquo;O taste
and see how gracious the Lord is.&rdquo;</p>

place at all? Are my intercessions private enclosures, intended only for
the select among my friends? Do I ever open the door to anyone outside my
family circle? Are my ecclesiastical sympathies large enough to include
&ldquo;outsiders&rdquo; from afar? What do I do with &ldquo;the stranger&rdquo;?</p>

<p>There is nothing which keeps prayer sweet and fresh and wholesome like the
letting in of &ldquo;the stranger&rdquo;! To let a new guest sit down at the feast of
my intercession is to give my own soul a most nutritious surprise. It is a
most healthy spiritual habit to see to it that we bring in a new
&ldquo;stranger&rdquo; every time we pray. Let me be continually enlarging the circle
of hospitality! Let some new and weary bird find a resting-place in the
branches of my supplications every time I hold communication with God.</p>

</div><p>ND that is the healthy order of all true worship. It begins in spacious
supplication in which &ldquo;the stranger&rdquo; finds a place. Then there is a lavish
consecration of self and substance. And then the wedding-bells begin to
ring, and &ldquo;the joy of the Lord is our strength!&rdquo; &ldquo;<em>They went unto their
tents joyful and glad of heart for all the goodness that the Lord had
done.</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>But so many suppliants miss the middle term, and therefore the gladness is
wanting. Supplication is not followed by consecration, and therefore there
is no exultation. It is a fatal omission. When we are asking for &ldquo;the gift
of God&rdquo; our request must be accompanied by the gift of ourselves to God.
If we want the water we must offer the vessel. No gift of self, no bounty
of God! No losing, no finding! &ldquo;When the burnt offering began, the song of
the Lord began.&rdquo;</p>

in one. And when Solomon had prayed, the holy Flame was in their midst.</p>

<p>But not only is the flame the symbol of the Holy; it also typifies the
power which can make me holy. We have no cleansing minister to compare
with fire. Where water fails fire succeeds. After an epidemic water is
comparatively impotent. We commit the infested garments to the flames. It
was the great fire of London which delivered London from the tyranny of
the plague. And so it is with my soul. God, who is holy flame, will burn
out the germs of my sin. He will &ldquo;purify Jerusalem with the spirit of
burning.&rdquo; &ldquo;Our God is a consuming fire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Come to my soul, O holy Flame! Place Thy &ldquo;burning bliss&rdquo; against my

consecrated souls. It is not the mode of worship, but the spirit of the
worshipper which forms the test of a consecrated people. If the worshipper
is defiled his temple becomes an offence. When the kernel is rotten, and I
offer the husk to God, the offering is a double insult to His most holy
name.</p>

<p>And yet, how tempted I am to assume that God will be pleased with the mere
outsides of things, with words instead of aspiration, with postures
instead of dispositions, with the letter instead of the spirit, with an
ornate and costly temple instead of a sweet and lowly life! Day by day I
am tempted to treat the Almighty as though He were a child! Nay, the Bible

culture is to know how to revere. There is an uncouth spirit of
self-aggression which, while it wounds and impoverishes others, destroys
its finest spiritual furniture in its own ungodly heat. The man who never
bows will never soar. To pay homage where homage is due is one of the
exercises which will help to keep us near &ldquo;the great white throne.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I know my peril, for I recognize one of the prevalent perils of our time.
Some of the old courtesies are being discarded as though they belonged to
a younger day. Some of the old tokens of respect have been banished to the
limbo of rejected ritual. Dignitaries are jostled in the common crowd.
&ldquo;One man is as good as another!&rdquo; And so there is a tendency to strip life
of all its reverences, and venerable fanes become stables for unclean
things.</p>

clean a room with a filthy duster. The surgeon cannot cut out the disease
if his instruments are defiled. While he removed one ill-growth he would
sow the seed of another. It must be health which fights disease. It will
demand a good temper to overcome the bad temper in my brother.</p>

<p>And therefore I must cultivate a virtue if I would eradicate a vice. That
applies to the state of my own soul. If there be some immoral habit in my
life, the best way to destroy it is by cultivating a good one. Take the
mind away from the evil one. Deprive it of thought-food. Give the thought
to the nobler mood, and the ignoble mood will die. And this also applies
to the faults and vices of my brother. I must fight them with their
opposites. If he is harsh and cruel, I must be considerate and gentle. If
he is grasping, I must be generous. If he is loud and presumptuous, I must
be soft-mannered and self-restrained. If he is devilish, I must be a
Christian. This is the warfare which tells upon the empire of sin. I can

<p>It must be the aim of a Christian to make his enemy lovely. It is not my
supreme business to secure my safety, but to remove his ugliness. He may
only annoy me, but he is destroying himself. He may injure my reputation;
but far worse, he is blighting his own character. Therefore must I seek to
remove the greater thing, the corrosive malady in his own soul. I must
make it my purpose to recover his loveliness, and restore the lost
likeness of the Lord.</p>

<p>And only love can make things lovely. Revenge can never do it. Even duty
will fail in the gracious work. There is a final touch, a consummate
bloom, to which duty can never attain, and which is only attainable by
love. All love&#8217;s ministries are creative of loveliness. Wherever her
finger rests, something exquisite is born. Love is a great magician: she
transforms the desert into a garden, and she makes the wilderness blossom
like the rose.</p>

<p>But where shall we get the love wherewith to make our enemy lovely? From
the great Lover Himself. &ldquo;We love, because He first loved us.&rdquo; The great
Lover will love love into us! And we, too, shall become fountains of love,
for our Lord will open &ldquo;rivers in the high places, and fountains in the

<p>&ldquo;<em>There is forgiveness with Thee.</em>&rdquo; That is the quickening river. Sin and
guilt scorch the fair garden of the soul as the lightning withers and
destroys the strong and beautiful things in woodland and field. The graces

<p>He is a gift of God, and therefore a &ldquo;means of grace.&rdquo; The Lord&#8217;s seal is
upon his ministry. How we impoverish ourselves by separating these
precious gifts from their Giver? We desecrate many a fair shrine by
emptying it of God. We turn many a temple into just a common house. When
we think of our friend let us link him to our Father, and fall upon our
knees in grateful praise.</p>

<p>He is God&#8217;s minister in his encouragements. When he cheers me, it is &ldquo;the
Sun of righteousness who rises with healing in His wings.&rdquo; All radiant
words are just lamps for &ldquo;the light of life.&rdquo; All genial speech carries
flame from the altar fire of heaven.</p>

<p>And he is God&#8217;s minister in his reproofs. He uses a clean knife: there is
no poison on the blade. And when he does surgeon&#8217;s work upon me, it is
clean work, healthy work, the relentless enemy of disease. Some men cut
me, and the wound festers. There is malice in the deed. My friend wounds
me in order that he may give me a larger, sweeter life.</p>

<p>In my Lord&#8217;s friendship there is <em>the ministry of sacrifice</em>. &ldquo;Greater
love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.&rdquo;
This great Friend is always giving His blood. It is a lasting shame when
professed Christians are afflicted with spiritual an&aelig;mia. And yet we are
often so fearful, so white-faced, so chicken-hearted, so averse from
battle, that no one would think us to be &ldquo;the soldiers of the Lord.&rdquo; We
need blood. &ldquo;Except ye drink my blood ye have no life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And in my Lord&#8217;s friendship there is the <em>privilege of most intimate
communion</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you.&rdquo; He
takes us into His confidence, and tells us His secrets. It is His delight
to lift the veil, and give us constant surprises of love and grace. He
discovers flowers in desert places, and in the gloom He unbosoms &ldquo;the
treasures of darkness.&rdquo; He is a Friend of inexhaustible resource, and His
companionship makes the pilgrim&#8217;s way teem with interest, and abound in
the wonders of redeeming grace.</p>

<p>There is &ldquo;<em>the armour of light</em>.&rdquo; Sunlight is the most sanative energy we
know. It is the foe of many a deadly microbe which seeks a lodging in our
bodies. Light is a splendid armour, even in the realm of the flesh. And so
it is in the soul. If the soul is a home of light, the eternal light, evil
germs will die as soon as they approach us. They will find nothing to
breed on. &ldquo;The prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And there is the armour of &ldquo;<em>faith and love</em>.&rdquo; The opposite to faith is
uncertainty, and the opposite to love is cynicism, and who does not know
that uncertainty and cynicism are the very hotbeds for the machinations of
the evil one? When faith is enthroned the soul is open to the reception of
grace, and when love shares the throne the sovereignty is invincible.</p>

<p>And there is the armour of &ldquo;<em>hope</em>.&rdquo; Even in a physical ailment a man has
a mighty ally who wrestles in hope. And when a man&#8217;s hope is in the Lord
his God all the powers in the heavenly places are his allies, and by his
hope he shall be saved.</p>

<p>AN we think of a more beautiful figure than this&mdash;&ldquo;<em>children of light</em>&rdquo;?
As I write these words I look out upon a building every window of which is
ablaze with light, every room the home of attractive brightness. And my
life is to be like that! And I look again and I see a lighthouse sending
out its strong, pure, friendly beams to guide the mariner as he seeks his
&ldquo;desired haven.&rdquo; And my life is to be like that! And I look once more, and
I see a common road lamp, sending its useful light upon the busy street,
helping the wayfarer as he goes from place to place. And my life is to be
like that!</p>

<p>And if my soul is all lit up in friendly radiance for others, the light
will be my own defence. Light always scares away the vermin. Lift up a
stone in the meadow, let in the light, and see how a hundred secret things
will scurry away. And light in the soul scares away &ldquo;the unfruitful works
of darkness&rdquo;; they cannot dwell with the light. Light repels the evil one;
it acts upon him like burning flame. Yes, we are well protected when we
are clothed in &ldquo;the armour of light.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But how can we become &ldquo;children of light,&rdquo; holy homes of protective and
saving radiance? Happily, it is not our lot to provide the light, it is
ours to provide the lamp. If we offer the lamp the Lord will give the
flame.</p>

in our home and miserly in the sanctuary. We multiply treasures which
bring us little profit, and we are niggardly where treasure would be of
most gracious service.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I dwell in a house of cedar,&rdquo; and yet I am thoughtless about God&#8217;s poor!

there are tribes of God&#8217;s people held in the tyranny of dark and hopeless

<p>T is by such lowliness that we arrive at our true sovereignty. All
spiritual treasures are hidden along the ways of humility, and it is
meekness which discovers them. The uplifted head of pride overlooks them,
and its &ldquo;finds&rdquo; are only pleasure of the passing day.</p>

<p>Lowliness is the secret of spiritual perceptiveness. I find my sight in
lowly places. The Sacred Word speaks of &ldquo;the <em>valley</em> of vision.&rdquo; I
usually associate vision and outlook with mountain summits, but in
spiritual realms the very capacity to use the heights is acquired in the
vale.</p>

<p>Lowliness is the secret of spiritual roominess. It is only the humble man
who has any room for the Lord. All the chambers in the proud man&#8217;s soul
are thronged with self-conceits, and God is crowded out. Our Lord always
finds ample room for Himself wherever the heart bows in humility and says:
&ldquo;I am not worthy that Thou shouldst come under my roof.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Serve Him with a perfect heart.</em>&rdquo; God&#8217;s chosen builders must be
characterized by singleness and simplicity. He can do nothing with
&ldquo;double&rdquo; men, who do things only &ldquo;by half,&rdquo; giving one part to Him and the
other part to Mammon. It is like offering the stock of a gun to one man
and the barrel to another; and the effect is nil. No, the entire gun! The
&ldquo;perfect heart&rdquo;!</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>And with a willing mind.</em>&rdquo; For the willing mind is the ready mind, and
God can do nothing with the unready. I never know just when He will call
me to add another stone to the rising walls of the New Jerusalem, and if I
am &ldquo;otherwise engaged&rdquo; I am a grievous hindrance to His gracious plans. He
must be willing and ready who would be a builder of the walls of Zion. And

a temple built in the substance of dreams, but never established in wood
and stone. And God took the shadowy structure and esteemed it as a
perfected pile. The sacred intention was regarded as a finished work. The
will to build a temple was regarded as a temple built. And hence I discern
the preciousness of all hallowed purpose and desire, even though it never
receive actual accomplishment. &ldquo;Thou didst well, it was in thine heart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And so the will to be, and the will to do, is acceptable sacrifice unto
the Lord! &ldquo;I wish I could be a missionary to the foreign field,&rdquo; but the
duties of home forbid. But as a missionary she is accepted of our God,
even though she never land on distant shore. Our purposes work, as well as
the work itself. Desire is full of holy energy as well as fruition. The
wish to do good is good itself; the very longing is a minister in the
kingdom of our God. If, therefore, we are to be judged by our aspirations,

God. My career itself must be chosen in His presence, and in the
illumination of His most holy Spirit. And in the subsequent days nothing
must be done that is not rooted and grounded in Him.</p>

<p>If I would be wise as a teacher I must begin with God. I must not merely
call Him in to bless my lesson when my labour is done. The very beginnings
of my thinkings must be in Him. Our Lord will not write an appendix to a
volume about which He has never been consulted. &ldquo;They who seek Me <em>early</em>

well, common bread, a friend&#8217;s sickness, the desolation of a garden, the
darkness of &ldquo;the last things&rdquo;&mdash;these all offered Him a mode of speech in
which He unveiled to me the heart of God.</p>

called my bondage freedom. I wore my badge of servitude with unholy pride.
But when He came and spake to me, my lost inheritance dawned upon my
wondering eyes, and I knew myself to be enslaved. But His was the glorious

<h2><em>GOD&#8217;S PRESENCE OUR DEFENCE</em></h2>

</div><p>HEN we invent little devices to protect us against the evil one, he
laughs at our petty presumption. It is like unto a child erecting sand
ramparts against an incoming sea. The only thing that makes the devil fear
is the presence of God. Our money can do nothing. Our culture can do
nothing. Our social status can do nothing. Only God can deal with devils.
&ldquo;By the greatness of Thine arm they shall be still as a stone.&rdquo; When Thou
art with me &ldquo;I will fear no evil&rdquo;; the fear shall be with my foes.</p>

<p>It is, therefore, the divine in anything which endows it with a strong
defence. If the holy God dwells in our culture, then our culture becomes
like an invulnerable fort. If God abides in our recreations, then our very
sports are armed against our foes. If &ldquo;the joy of the Lord&rdquo; is in our
festivity, then our very merriment is proof against the invasion of the
world. When the Lord is in us, fear dwells in the opposite camp.
&ldquo;Therefore will not we fear though the earth be removed, and though the
mountains be shaken in the heart of the seas.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><em>THE SINNER&#8217;S GUEST</em></h2>

<p class="center">&ldquo;<em>He is gone to be guest with a man that is a sinner.</em>&rdquo;<br />
&mdash;<span class="smcap">Luke</span> xix. 1-10.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 80px;">
<img src="images/img-i.png" width="80" height="80" alt="I" title="" />
</div><p>T was hurled as an accusation; it has been treasured as a garland. It was
first said in contempt; it is repeated in adoration. It was thought to
reveal His earthliness; it is now seen to unveil His glory. Our Saviour
seeks the home of the sinner. The Best desires to be the guest of the
worst. He spreads His kindnesses for the outcasts, and He offers His
friendship to the exile on the loneliest road. He waits to befriend the
defeated, the poor folk with aching consciences and broken wills. He loves
to go to souls that have lost their power of flight, like birds with
broken wings, which can only flutter in the unclean road. He went to
Zacch&aelig;us.</p>

<p>Yes, the Lord went to be &ldquo;guest with a man that is a sinner,&rdquo; and He
changed the sinner into a saint. The worldling found wings. The stone
became flesh. Gentle emotions began to stir in a heart hardened by
heedlessness and sin. Restitution took the place of greed. The home of the
sinner became the temple of the Lord. &ldquo;To-day is salvation come to this
house forasmuch as he also is a son of Abraham.&rdquo;</p>

</div><p>HAT was the wonder of wonders. Hitherto the light had been supposed to be
for Israel alone; and now a heavenly splendour was to fall upon the
Gentiles. Hitherto the light had been thought of as a lamp, illuming a
single place; now it was to be a sun, shedding its glory upon a world. The
&ldquo;people that sat in darkness&rdquo; are now to see &ldquo;a great light.&rdquo; New regions
are to be occupied; there is to be daybreak everywhere! &ldquo;The Sun of
Righteousness is arisen, with healing in His wings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To lighten the Gentiles!&rdquo; And thus the heavenly beams have come to thee
and me, to Europe and America, and to all the nations of the earth. The
amazing privilege is our personal inheritance. We are born to glorious
rights in Christ Jesus. But a wealthy heir may neglect this inheritance.
We may have the light and neglect our garden. We may have all the favours
of a blessed clime, and yet our life may be like a wilderness. The
Gentiles may have the light, and may yet be children of the darkness. It
is ours to believe in the light that our lives may become &ldquo;light in the
Lord.&rdquo;</p>

</div><p>Y Lord came as &ldquo;<em>the word</em>.&rdquo; He came as the expression of the mind of the
eternal God. Ordinary words could not have carried the &ldquo;good news.&rdquo;
Ordinary language was an altogether inadequate vessel for this new wine.
And so the mighty news was spoken in the incarnation of the Lord.</p>

<p>My Lord came as &ldquo;life.&rdquo; &ldquo;<em>In Him was life.</em>&rdquo; But not a mere cupful of
life, or even a cup running over. He came as &ldquo;the fountain of life.&rdquo; Nay,
if I had the requisite word I must get even behind and beyond this. For He
was the Creator of fountains. &ldquo;The water that I shall give him shall be
<em>in him a well</em>.&rdquo; Yes, He was the fountain of fountains!</p>

<p>The Lord came as &ldquo;light.&rdquo; &ldquo;<em>The life was the light.</em>&rdquo; True light is always
the child of life. Our clearest light comes not from speech or doctrine,
still less does it emerge from controversy. It is the fine, subtle issue
of fine living. And my light is to &ldquo;shine before men&rdquo; by reason of the
indwelling life of the Christ.</p>

<p>And my Lord came as &ldquo;power.&rdquo; &ldquo;<em>To them gave He power.</em>&rdquo; All the power I
need for a full, holy, healthy life I can find in Him. Every obligation
has its corresponding inspiration, and I am competent to do His will.</p>

</div><p>ND so the good news was told to shepherds, to working men who were
toiling in the fields. The coming King would hallow the common work of
man, and in His love and grace all the problems of labour would find a
solution.</p>

<p>The Lord of the Christmas-tide throws a halo over common toil. Even
Christian people have not all learnt the significance of the angels&#8217; visit
to the lonely shepherds. Some of us can see the light resting upon a
bishop&#8217;s crosier, but we cannot see the radiance on the ordinary
shepherd&#8217;s staff. We can discern the hallowedness of a priest&#8217;s vocation,
but we see no sanctity in the calling of the grocer, or of the scavenger
in the street. We can see the nimbus on the few, but not on the crowd; on
the unusual, but not upon the commonplace. But the very birth-hour of
Christianity irradiated the humble doings of humble people. When the
angels went to the shepherds, common work was encircled with an immortal
crown.</p>

<p>And it is in the Lord Jesus that all labour troubles are to be put to
rest. If we work from any other centre we shall arrive at confusion
confounded. &ldquo;I have the keys.&rdquo;</p>

of the Temple. The soul of old Simeon was filled with holy satisfaction
and peace. The cravings of the heart were quieted, and its desires found
the coveted feast in the holy Child of God.</p>

<p>And thus the Lord Jesus was not only to dignify the body but to gratify
the soul. He was to be most efficient where He was most needed. And this
has been the unfailing experience of the years. There is a hunger in my
soul for which I can find no satisfying bread. I have tried many breads; I
have tried nature, and art, and music, and literature, and I have tried
human fellowship and social service. But my soul is hungry still! And the
Lord Jesus comes to me, as I reverently grope in the vast temple, and He
&ldquo;satisfies the hungry soul&rdquo; with good things. His &ldquo;bread of life&rdquo; is very
wonderful; it lifts the soul into the restfulness of strength, and gives
me a strange buoyancy, and &ldquo;the glorious liberty of the children of God.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My soul, wait thou only on Him!&rdquo; He is thy hope, thy strength, and thy
salvation! He is &ldquo;the desire of all the nations.&rdquo;</p>

themselves with the vast and intricate problems of the mind. And the
evangel offered the students mental satisfaction, bringing the
interpreting clue, beaming upon them with the guiding ray which would lead
them into perfect noon.</p>

<p>Yes, our wise men must find the key of wisdom in the Lord. In a wider
sense than the meaning of the original word it is true that &ldquo;the fear of
the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.&rdquo; To seek mental satisfactions and
leave out Jesus is like trying to make a garden and leave out the sun.
&ldquo;Without Me ye can do nothing,&rdquo; not even in the unravelling of the
problems which beset and besiege the mind.</p>

<p>If my mental pilgrimage is to be as &ldquo;a shining light shining more and more
even unto perfect day,&rdquo; I must begin with Jesus, and pay homage to His
Kingly and incomparable glory. I must lay my treasures at His feet, &ldquo;gold,
and frankincense, and myrrh.&rdquo; Then will He lead me &ldquo;into all truth,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;the truth shall make me free.&rdquo;</p>

catastrophic, appalling! The most awful of the natural elements would have

came as a little child. The great God &ldquo;emptied Himself&rdquo;; He let in the

think of God as suspicious, inhumanly watchful, always looking round the
corner to catch me at the fall. That &ldquo;eye,&rdquo; placed in the sky of many a
picture, and placed there to represent God, filled my heart with a
chilling fear. That God was to me a magnified policeman, watching for
wrong-doers, and ever ready for the infliction of punishment. It was all a
frightful perversion of the gracious teaching of Jesus.</p>

<p>Heaven overflows with good will toward men! Our God not only wishes good,
He wills it! &ldquo;He gave His only begotten Son,&rdquo; as the sacred expression of
His infinite good will. He has good will toward thee and me, and mine and
thine. Let that holy thought make our Christmas cheer.</p>

gloom and the cold are all the more intense when there is death in the
house. In such conditions we are in great need of light and fire.</p>

<p>And that is how the children of men were feeling before the Saviour came.
They &ldquo;<em>sat in darkness</em>&rdquo; and in &ldquo;<em>the shadow of death</em>.&rdquo; The world was
cold, and sin and death were in it, and they longed for light and cheer.
And &ldquo;the great Light came,&rdquo; and His wonderful Presence not only illumines
the house but banishes the fear of sin and death. &ldquo;<em>They that dwelt in the
land of the shadow of death, upon them hath the light shined.</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Where can we get this living light except in the Lord Jesus Christ?
Everything else is candle-light! It fails us in the midnight. It flickers
amid conflicting currents. It goes out in the rough blast. The light of
art and of literature fails me when I need them most. When I sit in the
darkness, with death in the house, these kindly ministers have no
effective beams. I turn to the Master, and He shines upon me, and it is
daybreak in the soul!</p>

battlefield to see the human frame. It is like going to a refuse-heap to
see a bit of garden. Life is not found in fields of license; it is not
found among the wild oats of a dissipated youth. Life is found only in
Christ, and if we want to see a bit of life we must go to Him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In Him was life&rdquo;; and that not merely to be looked at but to be shared.
He is the well to which everybody can bring his pitcher, and take it away
filled. And my pitcher is just my need. &ldquo;All the fitness He requires is to

contemplate, and meditate, and appropriate, and saturate. And there are

students, who are always gazing, and who are continually crying, &ldquo;O the

out, and stretches his limbs in the sweet light and air of God&#8217;s free
world. Black servitude is ended; glorious liberty begins.</p>

<p>It is the blessedness of education. For when we are freed we are by no
means perfected. We are liberated babes; and our Emancipator does not
desert us in our spiritual infancy. The foundling is not abandoned.
&ldquo;Having loved His own He loved them unto the end.&rdquo; He begins with us in
the spiritual nursery, and He will train and lead and feed us until we are

<p>&ldquo;A fresh and striking contribution to current religious discussion.
It is the average man,&mdash;the man in the street&mdash;who is at once the
subject of Mr. Roberts&#8217; study. He is keenly alive to and frankly
critical of the weaknesses, shortcomings and divisions of modern
Christianity; but he has a well-grounded optimism and a buoyant
faith which will be found contagious.&rdquo;&mdash;<em>Living Age.</em></p>

of the Theological School of Boston University: &lsquo;It is the finest
apologetic for the modern mood of thought concerning things
Christian that I have seen. The book in a masterly manner reveals
the pathway of triumphant faith.&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash;<em>Christian Advocate.</em></p>
